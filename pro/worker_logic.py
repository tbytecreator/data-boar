"""
Process worker helpers for Pro+ discovery orchestration.

This module is intentionally top-level and stateless-friendly so functions are
picklable by ``ProcessPoolExecutor``.

Doctrine references (Slice 3 latency refactor):

- ``docs/ops/inspirations/DEFENSIVE_SCANNING_MANIFESTO.md`` §2 — sample caps,
  statement timeouts, and dialect posture are **relief valves, not knobs**. We
  do not gain throughput by relaxing precision; we gain it by removing
  algorithmic and memory waste in the composition layer.
- ``docs/ops/inspirations/THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md`` §2 — the Python fallback
  must not silently degrade. Same regex set, same Luhn validator, same
  acceptance contract as before; this refactor is **behavior-preserving**.
- ``docs/ops/inspirations/INTERNAL_DIAGNOSTIC_AESTHETICS.md`` §3 — one concept
  per line, no invented optimization labels.

    Open Core fallback that keeps CPF / email candidates plus Luhn-valid cards.

    Slice 3 — single-pass refactor (algorithmic efficiency only):

    The previous implementation walked ``payloads`` **twice**: once via
    :class:`~core.prefilter.OpenCorePreFilter` (CPF + email), then again to
    check Luhn-valid card numbers, with a ``set`` membership probe to avoid
    duplicates. The two-pass shape was the dominant tax in the
    ``tests/benchmarks/run_official_bench.py`` 200k profile, where the Pro
    Python fallback measured **0.574x** the throughput of the OpenCore
    baseline (``tests/benchmarks/official_benchmark_200k.json``).

    The new shape is a single pass, short-circuit ``or`` over the **same
    three predicates**:

    1. CPF candidate regex.
    2. Email candidate regex.
    3. Card-shape regex with Luhn validation.

    No regex was widened or narrowed. No sample cap was changed. No timeout,
    isolation level, or precision invariant was relaxed. The acceptance set
    is **identical** for any input — see ``tests/test_boar_orchestrator.py``
    and ``tests/test_basic_python_scan_single_pass_parity.py`` for parity
    pins.

    Memory: ``out`` grows in the same direction as before (filtered
    survivors). The previous helper allocated an extra ``list(candidates)``
    plus a ``set(candidates)`` for membership probing; both are gone in the
    fused loop.

    # Hoist the bound-method lookups out of the comprehension. This is a

    # ``out.append``) it removes the two largest allocation taxes from the
