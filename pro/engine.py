    The previous shape always materialized ``data_batch = [str(item) for
    item in chunk]`` even when ``chunk`` was already a ``list[str]`` (the
    common path: the orchestrator already coerces values to ``str`` in
    ``ProOrchestrator._row_to_payload``). For the recorded 200k profile
    (``tests/benchmarks/official_benchmark_200k.json``, Pro path at
    **0.574x** the OpenCore baseline) that copy was a per-chunk allocation
    we paid for nothing.

    Now we coerce only when the input is not already a ``list``-of-``str``
    — this preserves the contract for tuple / iterator / mixed-type inputs
    while skipping the redundant copy on the hot path. No precision,
    sample cap, timeout, or fallback predicate was changed.
