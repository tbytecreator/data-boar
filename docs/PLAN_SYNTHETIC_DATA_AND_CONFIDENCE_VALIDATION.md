# Plan: Synthetic and true-like data sources, confidence scoring, and operator guidance

**Status:** Not started
**Synced with:** [docs/PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) (central to-do list)

## When implementing steps: update docs and tests; then update PLANS_TODO.md and this file.

This plan enables **creation of synthetic and possible "true" data sources** that cover the full range of ingredients the app can ingest (all compatible file formats, network shares, SQL and NoSQL sources in popular flavors). It adds **intentional false positives and false negatives** so we can **validate and score how confident we are** in a discovery, and it delivers **operator-facing guidance**: from "probably nothing serious, but better safe than sorry" (with instructions to manually verify) to "chance of high risk of violation, but ML/DL may be struggling" (with how to manually verify and how to tune configs and options). It also covers **timeouts and connectivity/network I/O issues** with instructions on how to solve or prevent them for the next scan sessions.

---

## Goals

- **Synthetic and true-like data sources:** Provide or document how to create fixtures that include:
- **All compatible file formats** (txt, csv, tsv, json, xml, html, pdf, docx, odt, xlsx, msg, eml, etc. – see [connectors/filesystem_connector.py](../connectors/filesystem_connector.py) and text extraction).
- **Network shares:** SMB/CIFS, NFS, WebDAV, SharePoint – sample data or scripts to expose minimal shares for testing.
- **SQL:** PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle (popular flavors) – e.g. Docker Compose or in-memory DBs with known schema and rows.
- **NoSQL:** MongoDB, Redis, Snowflake – sample collections/keys/data.
- **False positives and false negatives:** In the fixture data, include:
- **Ground truth labels** (per column, file, or row: truly PII/sensitive vs not).
- **Intentional false positives:** Content that may trigger detection but is not real PII (e.g. lyrics with digits, fiction with fake CPF, tablature).
- **Intentional false negatives:** Real PII or sensitive data that is hard to detect (masked, non-standard format, rare pattern).
- Use these to **validate** detector behaviour and to **score** confidence (e.g. precision/recall per run or per pattern).
- **Confidence and operator guidance:** From each discovery (sensitivity_level, pattern_detected, ml_confidence), derive a **discovery confidence band** and **recommendations**:
- **Probably nothing serious:** Low/medium confidence or weak pattern; recommend "better safe than sorry" and **how to manually access and verify** (e.g. open the table/file, spot-check values).
- **High risk but ML/DL may be struggling:** High sensitivity but borderline confidence or conflicting signals; recommend **manual verification** and **how to tune** (regex_overrides_file, ml_patterns_file, dl_patterns_file, min_sensitivity, timeouts, sample_limit).
- **High confidence finding:** Strong pattern + high ml_confidence; still recommend verification and remediation steps.
- **Timeouts and connectivity:** Document and, where useful, **simulate** timeout and network I/O issues so that:
- The app’s existing **failure_hint** (unreachable, auth_failed, permission_denied, timeout) is surfaced in reports and docs.
- **Instructions** are provided: how to **solve** (increase timeout, check network, retry) and how to **prevent** for the next scan (config timeouts, network path, off-peak run).

---

## Current state

- **File formats:** [connectors/filesystem_connector.py](../connectors/filesystem_connector.py) and text extraction support txt, csv, tsv, json, xml, html, pdf, docx, odt, xlsx, ods, odp, msg, eml, etc. (SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS).
- **Connectors:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle), MongoDB, Redis, Snowflake, SMB, NFS, WebDAV, SharePoint, Power BI, Dataverse, REST API (see [TOPOLOGY.md](TOPOLOGY.md)).
- **Detection:** [core/detector.py](../core/detector.py) returns sensitivity_level, pattern_detected, norm_tag, ml_confidence (0–100). Report includes recommendations sheet and failure hints ([core/database.py](../core/database.py) `failure_hint(reason)`).
- **No shared synthetic dataset:** Tests use ad-hoc fixtures (e.g. in-memory SQLite, temp files). There is no single “synthetic + true-like” dataset with ground truth and intentional FP/FN for validation and confidence scoring.
- **Report:** Recommendations and scan failures already show hints; there is no explicit **discovery confidence band** (e.g. “probably nothing serious” vs “high risk, tune ML/DL”) nor a dedicated “operator guidance” section for manual verification and tuning.

## Scope: synthetic data ingredients

| Category        | Ingredients to cover                                                                 | Delivery (fixture / doc / script)        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------       |
| **Files**       | txt, csv, tsv, json, xml, html, pdf, docx, odt, xlsx, ods, msg, eml, etc.            | Fixture tree + ground-truth manifest     |
| **SQL**         | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle                                    | Docker Compose or in-memory + SQL dumps  |
| **NoSQL**       | MongoDB, Redis, Snowflake                                                            | Docker or test containers + seed data    |
| **Shares**      | SMB/CIFS, NFS, WebDAV, SharePoint                                                    | Scripts or minimal server + sample files |
| **APIs**        | REST (JSON), Power BI, Dataverse                                                     | Mock or minimal API + sample responses   |

Ground truth: for each fixture (file, table/column, API response), a **manifest** (YAML/JSON) states whether it contains real PII, no PII, or “tricky” (FP/FN) so we can compare scan output and compute precision/recall and confidence.

---

## False positives and false negatives (in fixtures)

- **False positive (FP):** Content that the detector flags as sensitive but that is **not** real PII (e.g. song lyrics with dates, guitar tab digits, novel with fake CPF). Include several in fixtures; label in manifest so we can measure FP rate and adjust thresholds or patterns.
- **False negative (FN):** Content that **is** PII/sensitive but the detector misses (e.g. masked CPF, non-standard date format, rare identifier). Include several; label in manifest to measure FN rate and improve regex/ML/DL or document “manual verification recommended”.
- **Use:** (1) Run scan on fixture set; (2) compare findings to manifest; (3) compute precision, recall, F1; (4) optionally **score confidence** per finding (e.g. “this finding matches a known FP” → lower confidence; “this finding matches known PII” → high confidence). Results can feed the **operator guidance** (e.g. “ML/DL may be struggling” when FN rate is high on tricky rows).

---

## Confidence bands and operator guidance

- **Inputs:** sensitivity_level, pattern_detected, ml_confidence (and optional dl_confidence), plus optional “matches_ground_truth” when running against labeled fixtures.
- **Bands (example):**
- **Probably nothing serious:** LOW sensitivity, or MEDIUM with low confidence and weak pattern (e.g. GENERAL). Guidance: “Better safe than sorry. Manually verify: [link or steps to open target and spot-check]. If confirmed non-sensitive, consider adding to ML non-sensitive terms or excluding path in config.”
- **Better safe than sorry:** MEDIUM sensitivity or HIGH with moderate confidence. Guidance: “Manually access and verify: [steps]. If PII confirmed, apply remediation; if false positive, tune regex_overrides or ml_patterns_file to reduce noise.”
- **High risk – verify and remediate:** HIGH sensitivity and high confidence. Guidance: “Treat as potential violation. Manually verify: [steps]. Remediate (mask, delete, or document base legal).”
- **High risk but ML/DL may be struggling:** HIGH sensitivity but low/borderline confidence, or pattern_detected = ML_DETECTED / ML_POTENTIAL with many FNs in validation. Guidance: “Manual verification strongly recommended. Consider tuning: (1) Add examples to ml_patterns_file / dl_patterns_file; (2) Adjust regex_overrides_file for your domain; (3) Increase sample_limit or review min_sensitivity; (4) See docs/sensitivity-detection.md for options.”
- **Report:** Add a column or section “Discovery confidence” and “Operator guidance” (short text or link to doc). Recommendations sheet can be extended with these messages per finding or per band.

---

## Timeouts and connectivity

- **Existing:** [core/database.py](../core/database.py) `failure_hint(reason)` already maps unreachable, auth_failed, permission_denied, timeout to human-readable next steps. Scan failures appear in the report with these hints.
- **Plan:** (1) **Document** in USAGE or a dedicated “Troubleshooting” section: how to **solve** (increase timeout in config or connector, check network/DNS/firewall, retry during off-peak) and how to **prevent** for the next scan (set timeouts, reduce parallelism, use stable network path). (2) Optionally add **fixture or test** that simulates a slow/timeout target so the report shows the timeout hint and we can assert the message. (3) Extend failure_hint or report text with a short “Prevent next time” line where useful (e.g. “Set scan timeouts in config; see docs/USAGE.md.”).

| 5.2 | Document how to use fixture set and scoring to tune config (add regex, ML terms, adjust min_sensitivity) and re-run to improve.             | ⬜      |
| 5.3 | Update PLANS_TODO.md and this plan; ensure “timeouts and connectivity” and “manual verify / tune” are in operator-facing docs.              | ⬜      |

---

## Dependencies and constraints

- **Fixtures are optional:** Main app and default tests do not depend on the full synthetic dataset; it is for validation and operator training. CI can run a subset if desired.
- **No secrets in fixtures:** Use only synthetic or anonymised data; no real PII in repo.
- **Confidence and guidance are additive:** Existing report columns and recommendation logic remain; new columns or section add information only.

---

## Conflict and placement in roadmap

- **No conflicts** with other plans. Additive (fixtures, manifest, report columns/section, docs).
- **Placement:** Independent; can follow or run in parallel with Compliance samples or Selenium QA. See [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md).
