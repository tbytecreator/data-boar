# ADR 0020 — CI must scan full Git history for PII anti-recurrence patterns

## Context

Tracked-file guards (`tests/test_pii_guard.py`) and incremental history checks catch many issues before merge, but **public Git history** can still contain sensitive literals in **old commits** unless the full object graph is scanned. Shallow CI checkouts would miss that class of defect.

## Decision

1. The **CI test job** runs `uv run python scripts/pii_history_guard.py --full-history` after the full pytest suite, on every push/PR to `main`/`master`.
2. **Checkout** for the test (and lint) jobs uses `fetch-depth: 0` so `git log --all` in the guard sees complete history.
3. Surgical remediation of past history uses `git filter-repo` and `scripts/filter_repo_pii_replacements.txt` (see `scripts/run-pii-history-rewrite.ps1`); **stale remote branches** that still point at pre-rewrite commits must be deleted or updated or the guard will still see old blobs via `refs/remotes/*`.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Regressions that reintroduce forbidden patterns anywhere in history fail CI before merge.
- **Cost:** Slightly longer CI (~seconds to low tens of seconds depending on repo size) and full clone bandwidth.
- **Operational:** Contributors must not rely on shallow clones if they run `--full-history` locally; CI remains the canonical full scan on clean trees.
