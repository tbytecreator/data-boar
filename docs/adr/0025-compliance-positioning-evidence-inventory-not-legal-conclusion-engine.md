# ADR 0025 — Compliance positioning: evidence and inventory, not a legal-conclusion engine

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-04-08

## Context

Data Boar discovers and labels **personal and sensitive data** across configured sources and produces **metadata-only** reports (locations, pattern types, framework-oriented recommendation text). Buyers and partners sometimes ask whether the product **eliminates legal risk**, **detects violations**, or **replaces** DPO/counsel. Over-stating capabilities would mislead regulated customers and create liability expectations the software cannot satisfy.

The product **is** configurable (**profiles**, **regex overrides**, **recommendation overrides**, **[compliance-samples/](compliance-samples/)**) and can be scoped with **professional services**—flexibility without changing this fundamental boundary.

## Decision

1. **Positioning:** Market and document the product as a **technical evidence and inventory** layer that **supports** governance, prioritisation, and specialist review—not as an **eliminator of legal risk** or an **automated legal-conclusion** system.

2. **Language:** Prefer **indicators for review**, **possible exposure**, **evidence for DPO/counsel**, and **metadata-only findings**. Avoid claiming **determination of violations**, **notifiability**, or **compliance certification** unless a future feature is explicitly designed and legally reviewed for that narrow scope (none today).

3. **Joint delivery:** Explicitly welcome a **three-way** value story—**product** (repeatable scans and artefacts) + **client legal/compliance** (judgment) + **optional consulting** (scoping and tuning)—without implying the product alone closes the loop.

4. **Documentation anchors:** Keep the public ceiling in **[COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL.md](../COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL.md)** and **[COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS.md](../COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS.md)**; keep deep regulator backlogs and horizon notes in **[PLAN_COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE_MAPPING.md](../plans/PLAN_COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE_MAPPING.md)** (internal). Do **not** require a separate **QA journal** file for this positioning; **gitignored** `docs/private/` remains available for **operator-only** commercial nuance per **[PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md](../PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md)**.

## Consequences

- Sales, pitch, and external docs must stay aligned with **COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL** wording; internal plans may explore **future** samples without becoming public **compliance promises**.
- New features that surface **legal-sounding** outputs need explicit **product** and **legal** review so outputs remain **indicators** unless scope intentionally changes (and docs update).
- Contributors can cite **this ADR** when deciding whether a proposed feature crosses from **inventory** into **legal opinion** or **regulated monitoring**.
