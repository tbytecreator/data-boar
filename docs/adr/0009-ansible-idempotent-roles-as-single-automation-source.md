# ADR 0009: Ansible idempotent roles as single automation source for T14 lab baseline

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-03

## Context

The ThinkPad T14 running LMDE 7 is the primary developer workstation and lab-op node. Over time,
configuration has been applied through a combination of ad-hoc shell commands (documented in
`LMDE7_T14_DEVELOPER_SETUP.pt_BR.md`) and one-off script execution. This created drift between
what the documentation described and what was actually installed — a problem that grew as the
baseline expanded from security hardening to include containers and observability tooling.

When a collaborator (or the operator after a fresh install) needs to reproduce the environment,
they face the question: "which commands are still valid? which were superseded?"

Two automation approaches were considered:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Shell scripts / manual steps** | Simple, readable | Not idempotent; hard to know if already applied; no state |
| **Ansible roles (idempotent)** | Re-runnable; state is declared; roles composable; variables override | Requires Ansible install; YAML verbosity |
| **OpenTofu/Terraform** | Declarative infra state; plan/apply | Needs a provider; not native for local OS config |

The operator had already adopted Ansible for the hardening baseline (`t14_baseline_packages`,
`t14_ufw`, `t14_fail2ban`, etc.). The natural extension is to cover **all** reproducible
configuration — not just hardening — within the same Ansible role model.

## Decision

1. **All reproducible configuration** of the T14 lab baseline is expressed as **Ansible roles**
   under `ops/automation/ansible/roles/`. New configuration areas get new roles, not new shell scripts.
2. **Roles are opt-in by default** (`false`) for anything that may have side effects
   (Docker CE, Podman, k3s, Wazuh agent, Swarm init, syslog forwarding). This keeps the baseline
   safe for a fresh install without requiring all flags to be set.
3. **Playbook `t14-baseline.yml`** is the single entry point — it documents all available knobs
   in its `vars:` block with explicit defaults. The operator or collaborator overrides what they need.
4. **OpenTofu** is retained as a complementary tool for provider-based infrastructure (DNS, GitHub,
   cloud resources) — it is **not** used for local OS configuration, where Ansible already suffices.
5. **The manual doc (`LMDE7_T14_DEVELOPER_SETUP.pt_BR.md`)** remains as narrative, troubleshooting
   guide, and explanation of *why* — it is **not** the source of truth for *what* is installed
   (the Ansible roles are). Commands in the doc are reproduced in roles; if they diverge, the
   role wins.
6. **Idempotency gate:** each role must be safe to re-run (`changed_when` and `failed_when` are
   set explicitly where commands are used instead of modules). A future CI job may enforce this
   with `ansible-lint`.

## Role taxonomy added in this decision

| Role | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `t14_docker_ce` | Docker CE from official repo + Compose plugin + Swarm opt-in | off |
| `t14_podman` | Podman rootless + buildah + skopeo + podman-compose | off |
| `t14_k3s` | k3s lightweight Kubernetes (installs from get.k3s.io) | off |
| `t14_observability` | iotop, iftop, ctop, munin-node, monit, node_exporter, rsyslog forwarding, Wazuh agent | CLI tools on; services opt-in |

## Consequences

- **Positive:** A collaborator arriving at the project can reproduce the full T14 environment by running
  one playbook with the appropriate `-e` overrides, without reading the full installation doc.
- **Positive:** Drift detection: if a role is re-run and reports `changed`, it signals unexpected
  state on the host.
- **Negative:** Ansible must be installed (`apt install ansible`) before the playbook runs — a
  chicken-and-egg problem for a bare install. Mitigated by §1 of `LMDE7_T14_DEVELOPER_SETUP.pt_BR.md`
  (Ansible install is the first automation step).
- **Negative:** Role YAML is more verbose than a shell one-liner. Mitigated by keeping roles
  small and single-purpose.
- **Watch:** As the lab grows to multiple hosts (L14, servers), the same roles should be extended
  or parameterised rather than duplicated. An `inventory.ini` with multiple hosts and group_vars
  is the expected next step.
