# Inspirations hub (start here)

**Português (Brasil):** [INSPIRATIONS_HUB.pt_BR.md](INSPIRATIONS_HUB.pt_BR.md)

Single **navigation page** for maintainer-chosen **external inputs** that shape Data Boar roadmap, docs tone, and hardening — without becoming automatic policy.

**Folder:** [`docs/ops/inspirations/`](README.md) (this directory).

## Security / GRC (hardening, compliance tone, threat framing)

**People (detailed under Security/GRC):** **Steve Gibson** is the primary public voice behind **Security Now**; full treatment stays in the notes above.

## Doctrine (normative manifestos)

Short, normative manifestos that consolidate our **engineering DNA**. Each
file states **do / don't** rules, cites mentor seeds, and points at the code
or rule that already enforces the doctrine.

## Engineering craft (people, products, narrative)

| [ENGINEERING_CRAFT_INSPIRATION_ANALYSIS.md](../ENGINEERING_CRAFT_INSPIRATION_ANALYSIS.md) | **Deep analysis**: thematic clusters, mimic/avoid, workflow, checklist — parallel to [SECURITY_INSPIRATION_GRC_SECURITY_NOW.md](../SECURITY_INSPIRATION_GRC_SECURITY_NOW.md). |

Use this when designing features, operator docs, or “how we explain trade-offs” — still **not** a substitute for threat modeling or tests.

## How to extend

1. Add a row to the relevant table file (security note vs engineering table).
1. Keep entries **short**; link out for depth (engineering craft: update [ENGINEERING_CRAFT_INSPIRATION_ANALYSIS.md](../ENGINEERING_CRAFT_INSPIRATION_ANALYSIS.md) when **cross-cutting themes** change, not for every new row).
1. If someone spans both (e.g. security + narrative), put **detail** in Security/GRC notes and a **pointer** in engineering craft if useful.
