# Operator manual actions (evidence, homelab, study)

**Purpose:** One tracked place for **your** work the agent cannot do: capturing evidence, homelab steps, photos/outputs for context, and **how** study/cert windows sit next to production readiness. No secrets here—put payloads in **`docs/private/`** (gitignored).

## 1. Study and certification window (2026)

- **Primary focus:** **Paid cyber (CWL)** — complete **BTF** → **C3SA** and the §3.2 list in [PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md](../plans/PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md); **stakeholder proof** = those certs + **shipped Data Boar** + compliance story. The IDE may use **non-Claude** models day to day; Anthropic study is **not** the top priority for **this** project track.
- **Alternating over the year:** **Anthropic Academy** (free; [Anthropic courses](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/resources/courses)) — sequence in PORTFOLIO §3.0 when you slot AI blocks. **CCA** later when eligible; Skilljar CCA page + unofficial [guide](https://aitoolsclub.com/how-to-become-a-claude-certified-architect-complete-guide/).
- **In parallel (thin thread):** **Priority band A** (Dependabot, Docker Scout, `check-all`)—[PLANS_TODO.md](../plans/PLANS_TODO.md) **–1** / **–1b**.
- **Optional:** Third-party **completion certificates** for CV—not vendor proctored exams.
- **If a CCA attempt does not pass:** Notes in `docs/private/`; **retake** later.

Sequencing rationale also appears in [SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.md](../plans/SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.md) §3.1 and [PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md](../plans/PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md) §3.0.

**Weekly rhythm (suggested):** **2** CWL blocks + **1** AI block; next week **2** CWL + **1** other (thesis, LGPD, homelab note); loop. Lighten when **Priority band A** (–1/–1b) or shipping spikes—see §4.

**Cursor / agent:** The assistant is guided to surface a **brief** study reminder at **natural code breakpoints** (slice done, session end)—see **`.cursor/rules/study-cadence-reminders.mdc`**. For an **immediate** recap in chat, type the English token **`study-check`** (see **`.cursor/rules/session-mode-keywords.mdc`**).

### What helps the agent on **Band A** and **homelab**

| Topic           | What to pass (no secrets in chat—paths or “done/not”)                                                                                                                                   |
| -----           | ------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                  |
| **Band A1**     | Dependabot / GitHub Security: **open alerts count**, or “triage this week yes/no”.                                                                                                      |
| **Band A2**     | Docker Scout / image: **any CVE you care about** or “rebuild done / pending”.                                                                                                           |
| **Band A3**     | Hub tags / publish: **operator-only** status in one line.                                                                                                                               |
| **Homelab –1L** | Which **matrix row** you’re on ([HOMELAB_VALIDATION.md](HOMELAB_VALIDATION.md) §9); **done / blocked** on §1–§2; paste outputs into `docs/private/` if you want the agent to cite them. |
| **Blockers**    | e.g. “no second host until date X”—stops wrong assumptions in plans.                                                                                                                    |

## 2. Evidence you can collect for the agent (manual)

Do **not** paste passwords or private keys into chat. Prefer:

| Action                                                   | Where to put it                                                                                      | Why                                      |
| ------                                                   | -----------------                                                                                    | ---                                      |
| Homelab inventory (hosts, roles, IPs redacted if needed) | `docs/private/homelab/` per [PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md](../PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md)                | Agent can `read_file` without `@`.       |
| Photos of gear, rack, labels (optional)                  | Same private tree; describe in a `.md` note what each image shows                                    | Visual context for topology discussions. |
| CLI outputs (`ssh`, `curl`, scan summaries)              | Paste into a dated note under `docs/private/` or session log                                         | Reproducible debugging.                  |
| Course / cert completion                                 | PDF or screenshot in `docs/private/`; add a row to PORTFOLIO §3 when you want it on the CV narrative | Keeps thesis/pitch aligned.              |

## 3. Homelab and validation

- **Criteria:** [HOMELAB_VALIDATION.md](HOMELAB_VALIDATION.md) ([pt-BR](HOMELAB_VALIDATION.pt_BR.md)) §1–§12.
- **What the agent can do:** Suggest commands, read **tracked** docs, read **`docs/private/`** when you maintain it—**not** SSH by itself without your terminal.
- **Operator snapshot for chat:** Keep **`docs/private/WHAT_TO_SHARE_WITH_AGENT.md`** current (gitignored). Layout and hints: [PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md](../PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md), [docs/private.example/author_info/README.md](../private.example/author_info/README.md).
