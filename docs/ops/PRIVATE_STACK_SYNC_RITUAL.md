# Stacked private repo — end-of-session ritual (operator)

**Português (Brasil):** [PRIVATE_STACK_SYNC_RITUAL.pt_BR.md](PRIVATE_STACK_SYNC_RITUAL.pt_BR.md)

**Purpose:** A **calm, repeatable** close for the **nested Git** under **`docs/private/`** (never GitHub `origin`), analogous in spirit to the public-repo **`eod-sync`** ritual but **only** for private history and backups.

**Session keyword (English-only):** **`private-stack-sync`** — see **`.cursor/rules/session-mode-keywords.mdc`**.

## What it is not

- **Not** a substitute for **`check-all`**, **`preview-commit`**, or **public** `main` hygiene.
- **Not** a place for **passwords**, **volume passphrases**, **keyfiles**, or **LAN-specific paths** in tracked files — those stay in **gitignored** notes or operator vaults.

---

## Typical flow (high level)

1. When the private tree has meaningful edits, ensure **`docs/private/`** is in a state you are willing to record (same idea as “honest commit” on `main`).
2. From the **product repo root**, run **`scripts/private-git-sync.ps1`** (optional **`-Push`** if your policy pushes the stacked repo to **non-GitHub** remotes).
3. If your workflow uses **encrypted local storage** for that tree, follow the **mount → work → unmount** discipline documented in **`docs/ops/PRIVATE_LOCAL_VERSIONING.md`** and your **private** homelab runbooks (not duplicated here).

### Operator expectation (generic — no drive letters or paths here)

During private-tree work, the operator may rely on a **VeraCrypt-mounted drive** staying available so the nested private tree remains writable and backup/sync routines stay valid. If that mount is **missing when expected**, treat it as a **workflow anomaly** and recover using **private** runbooks and vault-local secrets — **never** paste volume credentials into chat or into **tracked** files.

### Assistants — evidence mirrors (default)

When the operator asks to **verify alignment**, **check drift**, **sync private history**, or close hygiene that clearly touches **`docs/private/`**, treat **every reachable non-GitHub mirror** as **in the same job** — including SSH **`lab-*`** remotes **and** a **bare `notes-sync.git` on the VeraCrypt volume** when that path exists on the workstation (**`scripts/private-git-sync.ps1 -Push`** probes common mount letters). **Do not** ask redundant “should I also push to backup?” questions; **report** concrete failures (missing mount, SSH, **`safe.directory`** / dubious ownership) instead. Canonical rule: **`.cursor/rules/operator-evidence-backup-no-rhetorical-asks.mdc`** · **[ADR 0040](../adr/0040-assistant-private-stack-evidence-mirrors-default.md)**.
