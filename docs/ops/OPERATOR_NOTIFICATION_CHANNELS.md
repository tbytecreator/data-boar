# Operator notification channels — multi-path reachability

**Português (Brasil):** [OPERATOR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS.pt_BR.md](OPERATOR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS.pt_BR.md)

**Purpose:** When **CI fails**, **long jobs finish**, or a **human must return** to Cursor, prefer **at least two independent channels** so one outage (app blocked, DND, wrong account) does not block awareness. This doc is **policy + integration notes only**—**no secrets** in the repo (tokens in env, `docs/private/`, or GitHub **encrypted secrets**).

**Scope:** Maintainer / operator pings (you + agents automating checks). Product **tenant** notifications (scan-complete, etc.) stay in the main **Notifications** plan ([PLANS_TODO.md](../plans/PLANS_TODO.md) order 6)—reuse the same channel list where appropriate.

**Maintainer policy (this repository):** **Telegram is not used** for Data Boar operator or project notifications—trust posture and operator choice. The **only** chat alternative to **Slack** for ops pings is **Signal** (HTTP API from **`signal-cli`** / **signald** in Docker on your LAN or homelab—see §3 and **[private.example/notify/README.md](../private.example/notify/README.md)**). Do not add Telegram-based workflows or recommend Telegram for Data Boar reachability in tracked docs.

**Sequencing (maintainer):** **Channel A only**—GitHub **mobile app** plus watch/email settings—is **enough to start** for PRs, reviews, Dependabot, Security, and **failed Actions**. Tweak **GitHub → Settings → Notifications** and the official iOS/Android app. When you want **redundancy** or chat-native pings, add **B** (Slack—already wired in Actions) and/or **C** (Signal bridge); Slack is the lowest-friction vendor from GitHub Actions; Signal is the **preferred** second chat if you want to rely less on Slack’s UX. This doc is the **integration reminder** for those next steps.

## “CHAN-OK” quick proof (Slack) — 10 minutes, no guesswork

**Goal:** confirm **“message posts to the channel and notifies on desktop and iPhone.”**

1. **Webhook + secret (GitHub):** confirm `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` exists in **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
1. **Slack channel settings:** in the ops channel (e.g. `#data-boar-ops`), remove **mute** and set notifications to **All messages** (or at least mentions).
1. **Stronger signal (recommended):** create repo variable **`SLACK_MENTION_USER_ID`** (Settings → **Variables**) with your Slack **Member ID** (`U…`). This turns the ping into `<@U…>` and Slack tends to alert more reliably.
1. **Manual test:** GitHub **Actions → Slack operator ping (manual) → Run workflow**. (If there’s an input `mention_user_id`, also set your `U…` there.)
1. **Success criteria**:
   - Message appears in the channel **and**
   - you get a notification on **Slack Desktop** **and**
   - you get a notification on **iPhone** (Slack notifications enabled in iOS + Focus/DND not blocking).

If the message posts but you get **no notification**, it’s almost always channel notification settings, Focus/DND, or OS-level Slack permissions — see §4.2 D.

## 1. Recommended stack (least friction → most setup)

| Priority | Channel                       | Why                                                                                                                                    | Typical use                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | -------                       | ---                                                                                                                                    | -----------                                                                                                                   |
| **A**    | **GitHub**                    | Already tied to the repo; **mobile app** push for assignments, review requests, **failed workflow** runs, Dependabot, Security alerts. | Turn on notifications for **data-boar**; watch **Actions** failures; optional **Issue** opened by automation with `@mention`. |
| **B**    | **Slack** (workspace you use) | **Incoming webhook** (one URL) or bot; easy from GitHub Actions `curl`.                                                                | Single `#data-boar-ops` channel; webhook in repo secret `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.                                                  |
| **C**    | **Signal**                    | Strong privacy; **REST** via **`signal-cli`** / **signald** in **Docker** (linked device / LAN bridge).                               | `curl` from Actions or local script to `SIGNAL_NOTIFY_URL` / homelab endpoint; secrets only in GitHub or `docs/private/notify/`. |

**Practical minimum:** **A + B** (GitHub + Slack webhooks) matches current CI workflows. **A + C** (GitHub + Signal only) is valid if you post from a **trusted runner** or **local script** to your Signal bridge—**Telegram is not** a substitute path for this project.

### 1.1 Phased rollout: Slack (Actions) + Signal (preferred second chat)

**Slack** remains the **default** GitHub Actions integration (incoming webhook, one secret). **Signal** is the **endorsed non-Slack chat** for Data Boar: same short text to a **private REST** endpoint on your LAN (Docker image you operate—see §3).

| Phase | Channels      | Goal                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | --------      | ----                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **1** | **A + B**     | GitHub push/email + **Slack** `#data-boar-ops` (or your channel): **manual ping** workflow, **CI failure** workflow (when `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set), optional same webhook in app config for scan-complete (USAGE).  |
| **2** | **A + B + C** | Add **Signal**: **home-lab HTTP bridge** (§3) + secret e.g. `SIGNAL_NOTIFY_URL` (or generic `NOTIFY_SECONDARY_URL`). Same workflow or script posts **the same short text** to Slack **and** Signal where secrets exist. |

**Why both Slack and Signal:** Independent failure modes (Slack outage vs your Signal bridge vs GitHub app). **Do not** add Telegram as a third vendor for this repository.

**CI sketch:** One reusable step/script: if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` → `curl` Slack; if `SIGNAL_NOTIFY_URL` → `curl` Signal REST on LAN (or tunnel); failures on one branch **do not** block the other (log warning, continue).

---

## 2. GitHub (recommended baseline)

- **Watch** the repository with a mix that includes **Actions** and **Security alerts** (as you prefer).
- **Failed workflow:** ensure branch protection / required checks so merges don’t skip CI; failures surface in the app and email/push.
- **Automation → human:** a scheduled or `workflow_dispatch` job can **open or comment on an Issue** (`gh issue create` / API) with a short summary; you get a **standard GitHub notification** on iPhone.

**Cursor mobile (companion):** Useful for **lightweight chat / agent follow-up** when you are away from the desktop. It does **not** replace **GitHub** push notifications for **failed Actions**, **Dependabot**, or **Security**—keep **channel A** (official **GitHub** mobile app + notification settings) for those.

No custom server required; use **GITHUB_TOKEN** in Actions (permissions scoped in the workflow).

---

## 3. Signal (Docker / CLI — advanced)

Community setups often use **`signal-cli`** or **`signald`** (REST/gRPC) in **Docker**, with a **linked device** or number registration flow. Behaviour you described matches common patterns:

- Messages **from your linked identity** to **contacts** use normal delivery semantics.
- **Note to self** / “annotation” UX when messaging **your own** number or linked device can appear as a conversation with yourself—useful for **operator reminders**.

## Caveats (read before investing):

- **Operational:** container restarts, pairing/QR, backups—plan for **recovery** if the linked session breaks.
- **Legal / ToS:** use only official or well-audited images; comply with **Signal** terms and local law.
- **Automation:** the agent in Cursor **cannot** hold your Signal session; only **your** runners (home server, laptop script, CI with secrets you control) should call the API.
- **LAB‑OP offload:** Running the Signal Docker image on **another lab machine** (not the dev PC) is a good fit: your workstation sends **`curl`** (headers + JSON body) to the REST API on the LAN—same integration style as **Uptime Kuma** webhooks. Lock the service to **private network**; store the URL/token only under **gitignored** `docs/private/notify/`. See **[private.example/notify/README.md](../private.example/notify/README.md)** § *Signal on a different machine*.

**Priority:** For this maintainer, Signal is the **only** non-Slack chat channel used for Data Boar ops pings—after GitHub (**A**) and alongside or instead of Slack webhooks depending on your wiring.

## 4. Slack vs Signal (quick comparison)

|                      | Slack                                                 | Signal (this project)                                                                 |
| ---                  | ---                                                   | ---                                                                                    |
| **Setup**            | Slack app → Incoming Webhook to channel               | **`signal-cli`** / **signald** in Docker; REST on **private LAN**; see §3              |
| **From Actions**     | `curl -X POST -d '{"text":"..."}' $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | `curl` to your bridge URL + JSON body (per image docs); secret `SIGNAL_NOTIFY_URL` etc. |
| **Operator stance**  | Lowest friction for GitHub Actions                    | **Preferred** chat UX for some operators; **not** Telegram—policy in intro paragraph   |

Implement **one generic “notify” step** in CI (bash/PowerShell) that posts the same payload to **Slack and/or Signal** if secrets exist (independent `curl`s; failures on one path do not block the other).

### 4.1 Slack setup checklist (channel B)

1. In your Slack workspace, create a channel (e.g. **`#data-boar-ops`**).
1. Create an [**Incoming Webhook**](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for your workspace (Slack app → choose channel → copy the webhook URL).
1. On GitHub: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** — name **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`**, value = the webhook URL.
1. **Smoke test:** **Actions → Slack operator ping (manual) → Run workflow** (optional custom message). If the secret is unset, the job is **skipped** (no failure).
1. **Optional @mention for mobile/desktop push:** Repository **variable** **`SLACK_MENTION_USER_ID`** (Slack member ID, `U…`) — see §4.2 D). Manual ping also accepts input **`mention_user_id`** for a one-off test.
1. **CI / Semgrep failure ping (phase 1):** workflow **`Slack CI failure notify`** (`.github/workflows/slack-ci-failure-notify.yml`) runs when **`CI`** or **`Semgrep`** finishes with **`failure`** (push/PR to `main` or `master`). Uses the **same** `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. If the secret is unset, the notify job is **skipped**. The Slack line uses the failing workflow’s display name (e.g. **Test (Python 3.13)** or **Semgrep (OSS, Python)**). *Fork PRs:* failures may still produce a ping—reduce noise later (branch filters) if needed.
1. **Release published ping (opt-in):** workflow **`Slack release published notify`** (`.github/workflows/slack-release-published-notify.yml`) posts a short message when a GitHub Release is published. Toggle with repo variable **`SLACK_NOTIFY_RELEASE_PUBLISHED=true`**.
1. **PR merged ping (opt-in):** workflow **`Slack PR merged notify`** (`.github/workflows/slack-pr-merged-notify.yml`) posts when a PR is merged into `main`/`master`. Toggle with **`SLACK_NOTIFY_PR_MERGED=true`**.
1. **Ops digest (manual + scheduled opt-in):** workflow **`Slack ops digest`** (`.github/workflows/slack-ops-digest.yml`) supports `workflow_dispatch` and weekday schedule. Scheduled posts are enabled only with **`SLACK_NOTIFY_DAILY_DIGEST=true`**; manual dispatch always works when secret exists.
1. **Product / scan-complete:** reuse the same webhook URL in Data Boar **`config.yaml`** or env (see [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md) — operator notifications); separate from Actions workflows above.
1. **Backlog (optional):** scheduled digest via [scripts/notify_webhook.py](../../scripts/notify_webhook.py) or KPI export once you want EOD/sprint summaries (see §7).

### 4.2 Slack incoming webhook — operator how-to (grab URL, store it, verify)

**Goal:** One Incoming Webhook URL, stored as **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`** on GitHub, used by **`Slack operator ping (manual)`** and **`Slack CI failure notify`**.

#### A) Get the webhook URL (Slack, browser)

1. Sign in at [slack.com](https://slack.com) with the workspace you use for ops alerts.
1. Open **[Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)** (`https://api.slack.com/apps`).
1. **Create New App** → **From scratch** → name it (e.g. **`Data Boar notifications`**) → choose your **workspace** → **Create App**.
1. In the app settings sidebar, open **Incoming Webhooks** → turn **Activate Incoming Webhooks** **On**.
1. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace** → pick the channel (e.g. **`#data-boar-ops`**) → **Allow**.
1. Copy the **Webhook URL** — it must look like `<https://hooks.slack.com/services/..>.` (three path segments). **Do not** share it in issues, PRs, or public chat.

If your workspace blocks custom apps, ask a workspace admin to approve app install or create the webhook using a policy-compliant process.

#### B) Where to save it (canonical + optional backup)

| Store                                            | What you do                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Why                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -----                                            | -----------                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ---                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **GitHub Actions (required for CI workflows)**   | Repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** → name **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`** (exact spelling) → paste URL → **Add secret**.                                                       | Actions reads this secret; nothing hits the repo files.                                                                                                                       |
| **Password manager (optional)**                  | e.g. Bitwarden **secure note**: title `GitHub SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL — <repo name>`; paste the same URL.                                                                                                             | Recovery if you rotate the webhook or recreate the secret. See [OPERATOR_SECRETS_BITWARDEN.md](OPERATOR_SECRETS_BITWARDEN.md) ([pt-BR](OPERATOR_SECRETS_BITWARDEN.pt_BR.md)). |
| **`config.yaml` / env (optional, product path)** | Only if you want **scan-complete** Slack from a running Data Boar instance — same URL in **`notifications`** (see [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md)). Use env or a **gitignored** local config; **never** commit the URL. | Separate from GitHub Actions; same webhook is allowed.                                                                                                                        |

**Do not** save the webhook in: committed Markdown, `docs/private/` **if** that tree syncs somewhere risky without encryption, screenshots in tickets, or this chat as the only copy.

#### C) After you’re done — where to look (sanity checks)

| Check                     | Where                                                                            | What “good” looks like                                                                                                                       |
| -----                     | -----                                                                            | ----------------------                                                                                                                       |
| Secret exists             | GitHub → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**                          | **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`** listed (value is **hidden**; that’s normal).                                                                         |
| Manual ping works         | **Actions** → **Slack operator ping (manual)** → **Run workflow** → open the run | Job **succeeded** (not **skipped**). **Skipped** usually means secret missing/misnamed or workflows not on the branch GitHub runs.           |
| Message arrived           | Slack → your ops channel                                                         | New message with the text you sent (or the default ping line).                                                                               |
| CI / Semgrep failure path | After a real **`CI`** or **`Semgrep`** failure (or a test branch)                | **Actions** shows **Slack CI failure notify** run; Slack shows **“Data Boar — &lt;workflow name&gt; falhou”** with a link to the failed run. |

If **manual** job is **skipped**, confirm the secret name is exactly **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`** and that `.github/workflows/slack-operator-ping.yml` is on the default branch (or the branch you run Actions from).

#### D) Message posted but no mobile or desktop push

An **incoming webhook** only **posts to a channel**. That is not the same as a **personal notification**: Slack may show the message in the channel without **pushing** to your iPhone, Android, or Windows desktop if:

- The channel is **muted** or set to notify only for **mentions** / keywords.
- A **notification schedule**, **Focus**, or **Do Not Disturb** is blocking alerts.
- OS-level permissions for the **Slack** app are off (iOS **Settings → Slack → Notifications**, Windows **Focus assist**, etc.).

**What usually fixes it:**

1. **Slack channel:** Open the ops channel → channel name → **Notifications** (or channel settings) → choose **All messages** / **Every new message** for that channel, or at least **unmute** the channel.
2. **Optional @mention (recommended for CI + manual ping):** Add a repository **variable** (Settings → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **Variables** tab) named **`SLACK_MENTION_USER_ID`** with your Slack **member ID** (starts with `U`, for example `U0123ABCD`). Find it: Slack → your avatar → **Profile** → **More** → **Copy member ID** (labels vary slightly by client). The workflows **`Slack operator ping (manual)`** and **`Slack CI failure notify`** will prepend `<@USER_ID>` to the message so Slack applies your **mention** notification rules (typically a stronger mobile/desktop alert than “any channel message”). For a one-off test without saving the variable, use the **`mention_user_id`** input when running the manual ping workflow.
3. **GitHub (channel A):** Install the official **GitHub** mobile app and enable notifications for **Actions** / workflow runs under **GitHub → Settings → Notifications** on the web; on iPhone, also check **Settings → GitHub** for notification style. Cursor mobile does **not** replace GitHub push for failed Actions (see §2).

**Do not** paste your member ID into public issues or commits; keep it in the **Variables** UI only.

---

## 5. Multi-channel pattern

1. **Primary:** GitHub (issue comment or failed check).
1. **Secondary:** **Slack** (webhook) and/or **Signal** (REST bridge)—**not** Telegram for this repository.
1. **Redundancy upgrade:** **Slack + Signal together** (see §1.1)—same payload to both when you want **two chat vendors** plus GitHub.

**Do not** store webhooks or bot tokens in git; use **GitHub Actions secrets** and/or a local `.env` listed in `.gitignore`.

## 6. Optional KPI snapshot + notify

**X editorial pace (Slack, workstation):** [scripts/social-x-pace-remind.ps1](../../scripts/social-x-pace-remind.ps1) reads the gitignored hub file `docs/private/social_drafts/editorial/SOCIAL_HUB.md` (present on the maintainer workspace only; one-line shortcut at `docs/private/social_drafts/SOCIAL_HUB.md` has no inventory table) and lists **X** inventory rows that are still **`draft`** with **Alvo editorial** on or before today. With **`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`** set in the **local environment** (same Incoming Webhook URL as GitHub Actions—see §4.1) and **`-Slack`**, it POSTs one short message to the webhook’s channel (e.g. **`#data-boar-ops`**). Optional **`SLACK_MENTION_USER_ID`** for a leading `<@U…>`. Schedule a **daily** Task Scheduler job on the dev PC if you want pings without opening Cursor. **GitHub-hosted cron cannot** read private `docs/private/` on your machine—this path is **local-first**. Cursor session keyword **`x-pace-check`** reminds from chat; **`x-posted`** validates after you publish—see gitignored `docs/private/social_drafts/editorial/OPERATOR_X_PACE_AND_VALIDATION.pt_BR.md`.

Baseline script: [scripts/kpi-export.py](../../scripts/kpi-export.py) (needs `gh auth`). **Optional extension (backlog):**

- **Weekly** `workflow_dispatch` or cron workflow: run `python scripts/kpi-export.py --out kpi_snapshot.md`, upload as **artifact**, or post excerpt to **Slack** and/or **Signal** (never Telegram for this maintainer policy).
- **Do not** commit snapshots with live URLs if they’re sensitive; keep artifacts **retention short** or post summary only.

See [PLAN_READINESS_AND_OPERATIONS.md](../plans/PLAN_READINESS_AND_OPERATIONS.md) §4.7.

## 7. End-of-day / end-of-sprint digest (SMS, email, chat)

**What the AI cannot do:** The Cursor agent **does not** send **SMS** or **email** to your phone or inbox. There is no built-in carrier/SMTP integration from chat. Anything that “pings” you must run in **your** environment: **GitHub Actions**, a **home server**, or a **script** you execute locally.

## What you can build (recommended pattern):

| Piece                  | Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -----                  | -------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Trigger**            | **`workflow_dispatch`** (“send digest now”), **cron** (e.g. weekdays 18:00 in your TZ) for EOD, or **on release merge** / calendar rule for sprint end.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Short summary**      | First lines of **`git log`** since last tag or `--since=…`; optional **`python scripts/plans-stats.py`** for plan-dashboard counts; one paragraph of “main actions / main changes” you or a template fills.                                                                                |
| **Release notes**      | Link to **`docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md`** on `main` (or attach as workflow **artifact**); avoid pasting secrets or internal URLs.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Progress / PM view** | Paste the **Kanban** table from [SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.md](../plans/SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.md) or a **Mermaid `gantt`** block as **plain text** in the message. The agent can **draft** that Markdown in chat; **CI** sends it—you copy nothing manually if the workflow builds the body. |
| **SMS**                | **Twilio** (or similar) **HTTP API** from Actions; store **Account SID / auth token / From** in GitHub **secrets**; costs and compliance are **yours**.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Email**              | SMTP via an Action (e.g. **`dawidd6/action-send-mail`**) or your provider’s REST API; **secrets** for credentials.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Low-friction**       | **Slack** webhook and/or **Signal** `curl` to your LAN bridge (same as §2–§4)—often enough for “end of day” without SMS fees.                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Twilio (SMS API — optional):** **Twilio** is a US-based **CPaaS** (*Communications Platform as a Service*) vendor: one **HTTP API** to send **SMS** across many countries without a direct contract with each mobile operator—why it appears often in tutorials and pairs well with **GitHub Actions** or a **`curl`** script. You typically pay **per message** (and sometimes for a **sender number**); rates depend on **destination country** and product—use the official **[Twilio SMS pricing](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/pricing)** page for a current quote, not a fixed number in this doc. **Alternatives:** **AWS SNS**, **Vonage**, or **local carriers** in your region. Data is processed on **US** (and other) Twilio infrastructure; separate **marketing** SMS rules from **personal operational** pings; involve **counsel / DPO** if your org needs that check.

**Scope split:** Maintainer **digests** (this section) are separate from **product** notifications (scan finished, webhooks to tenants)—see **Notifications** in [PLANS_TODO.md](../plans/PLANS_TODO.md) (order 6).

**Local-first pattern (Docker + bind mount):** Run **signald** / **signal-cli** or an SMS client **on your workstation or homelab**. Map **credentials and session data** into the container with **volumes** pointing at a **gitignored** directory—e.g. create **`docs/private/notify/`** using the tracked blueprint **[private.example/notify/README.md](../private.example/notify/README.md)**. Put **`.env`**, Signal state, and anything personal **only** there. **Trigger** delivery with a **script you execute** (or a local scheduler); the repo stays free of secrets. **Other contributors** replicate the **same layout** under **their** `docs/private/notify/` with **their** own keys and numbers—nothing sensitive is shared through Git.
