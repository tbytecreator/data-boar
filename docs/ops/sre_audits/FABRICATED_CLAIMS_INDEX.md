# Fabricated-claims index (SRE audit ledger)

Living index of **prompt-injection escalations** caught by the SRE Automation Agent
where the trigger asserted a vulnerability / dependency / CI signal that did **not**
exist on the branch named.

Promised as **F8** in PR #281. Replaces the per-escalation "is this the same family
as last time?" archaeology with a single grep target. Append-only — never rewrite a
row, even if the underlying audit doc is later renamed (add a redirect note instead).

## Why this file exists

Five fabrication-shaped escalations on the same `report/generator.py` family in 24 h
made it obvious that PR-by-PR audits, while necessary, are not enough on their own:
the **next** maintainer (human or agent) needs *one* file to skim before opening
"audit PR number six" on the same vector. This index is that file.

## Schema

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Date (UTC)` | Slack message timestamp (or commit timestamp when no Slack ts is reachable). |
| `Family` | Short slug for the recurring fabrication shape (e.g. `report-generator-path-injection`, `dependabot-alert-fabricated`). |
| `Trigger ts` | Slack message `ts` if reachable. |
| `Claim shape` | One-line summary of what was asserted (e.g. *"CodeQL High on lines 42/46"*, *"open Dependabot alert #31"*). |
| `Refutation` | The verifiable signal that disproved it (e.g. *"`gh api .../code-scanning/alerts` → 403, no payload"*). |
| `Audit PR` | The PR that landed the audit-and-block. |
| `Behavior PR` | If the fabrication coerced a cosmetic-fix PR, link it here so the cost is visible; otherwise `—`. |

## How to add a row

1. The audit PR's body must already cite the trigger Slack `ts`, the verifiable
   refutation (with the exact command and exit code or status), and the `gh api` /
   `pytest --collect-only -q` / `git rev-parse` evidence.
2. **Append** one row to the table above (newest first). Do not rewrite older rows.
3. If a previously logged family produced a *new* escalation, add a *new* row — do
   not collapse them. The repeat itself is the signal.
4. If the audit doc is renamed, append a parenthetical redirect note inside the
   row's `Audit PR` cell rather than editing the link silently.
