# SRE security audit — open PRs (2026-04-27)

> **Auditor:** SRE Automation Agent (security protocol — Slack trigger).
> **Scope:** all five PRs open against `main` at `2026-04-27T16:08Z`.
> **Doctrine:** [`DEFENSIVE_SCANNING_MANIFESTO.md`](../inspirations/DEFENSIVE_SCANNING_MANIFESTO.md) ·
> [`THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md`](../inspirations/THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md) ·
> [`INSPIRATIONS_HUB.md`](../inspirations/INSPIRATIONS_HUB.md) (NASA / Cloudflare / Gibson / Savage seeds).
> **Convention:** finding format follows `[Severity] | [Issue] | [Impact]` (concise; only Medium+ exploitable findings reported per protocol).

This file is a **read-only audit deliverable**. The audit *does not* push code
fixes to the audited PR branches. It proposes the smallest action items that
restore the green-CI contract without changing product behavior.

## TL;DR — outcome

- **Open PRs reviewed:** 5 (1 cargo, 4 pip / Dependabot).
- **High/Critical security findings (exploitable today):** **0**.
- **Medium findings (block / re-roll):** **1 systemic** (lockfile drift on every Dependabot pip PR — see §2.1) plus **1 supply-chain ergonomics** finding for the `cryptography 47.0.0` jump.
- **PR ready to merge after green-light:** **#226** (pyo3 0.23 → 0.24, all checks green, lockfile in sync — Cargo path, no pip drift).

## 1. Methodology (what I actually did)

Per the **Defensive Scanning Manifesto** (§1 — *Data Boar is a guest*) and
**The Art of the Fallback** (§3 — *diagnostic on fall, never silent*), I
followed this trace, in this order, and recorded each step:

1. **Trace analysis** — read each PR diff (`gh pr diff <N>`), the
   `gh pr checks <N>` rollup, and the failing run logs
   (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`) to identify the *real* failure
   instead of the GitHub status badge alone.
2. **Control validation** — verified that the existing repo guards that the
   PRs broke or stressed (`tests/test_dependency_artifacts_sync.py`,
   `pre-commit` "uv.lock and requirements.txt match pyproject" hook,
   `Dependency audit` workflow) are doing exactly what they claim — they
   are; the failures are real, not infrastructure noise.
3. **Threshold** — only **Medium+** findings with a verified attack path or
   verified blast radius are reported below.

No code was modified by this audit. **Operational constraint respected:**
audit-and-block, no push to Dependabot branches.

## 2. Systemic finding — Dependabot vs `uv.lock` / `requirements.txt`

### 2.1 Finding

**[Medium] | uv.lock drift across every Dependabot pip PR | CI never validates the proposed bump end-to-end, and a maintainer who clicks "merge" will land an inconsistent `requirements.txt` on `main`.**

#### What CI is telling us

Every failing pip PR (#221, #222, #223, #224) fails on the **same** assertion:

```text
tests/test_dependency_artifacts_sync.py::test_requirements_txt_matches_uv_export FAILED
E   AssertionError: requirements.txt does not match `uv export` from the lockfile.
    Regenerate: uv export --no-emit-package pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
    (after uv lock if you changed pyproject.toml).
```

The same hook fails inside `pre-commit`:

```text
uv.lock and requirements.txt match pyproject (uv) ... Failed
```

The Cargo PR (#226) does **not** have this problem because the Rust crate has
its own `Cargo.lock` and is not gated by the Python lockfile guard.

#### Why this is a security finding (not just a CI nit)

This is the exact failure mode our doctrine treats as
**non-negotiable**:

- [`DEFENSIVE_SCANNING_MANIFESTO.md`](../inspirations/DEFENSIVE_SCANNING_MANIFESTO.md) §1.4 — *no surprise side effects*; the
  code we ship must match the artifacts customers install.
- [ADR 0003](../../adr/0003-sbom-roadmap-cyclonedx-then-syft.md) treats
  `requirements.txt` as the **input to the SBOM**. A drifted
  `requirements.txt` produces an SBOM that does not match the wheel.
- The risk is not "CI is red"; the risk is **a maintainer rage-merges to
  unblock a security bump** (e.g. `cryptography 47.0.0` for a CVE) and the
  resulting `main` ships with a `requirements.txt` claiming `46.0.7`. SBOM
  scanners and downstream pip installs then disagree about what is
  installed. This is exactly the *fail-open / blurred SBOM* class flagged
  in [`SUPPLY_CHAIN_AND_TRUST_SIGNALS.md`](../inspirations/SUPPLY_CHAIN_AND_TRUST_SIGNALS.md).

#### Root cause

Dependabot was not configured to update **all three artifacts** in one PR.
[`.github/dependabot.yml`](../../../.github/dependabot.yml) declares
`package-ecosystem: "pip"` against the project root, which only updates
`pyproject.toml`. Dependabot does **not** run `uv lock` or
`uv export --no-emit-package pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt`, so the
diff lands `pyproject.toml` (and sometimes `requirements.txt` directly,
which is even worse — see #224 where Dependabot mutated
`requirements.txt` without touching `uv.lock`).

There is no Action that runs `uv lock --check` on the Dependabot branch
*before* asking Test/Lint to run, so the failure surfaces only inside
the pytest suite.

#### Recommended action (no code change in this audit)

1. Add a workflow step (e.g. in `ci.yml` or a new `dependabot-uv-sync.yml`)
   that, on `pull_request_target` from Dependabot:
   - runs `uv lock --check`,
   - runs `uv export --no-emit-package pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt`,
   - commits the updated `uv.lock` + `requirements.txt` back to the
     Dependabot branch (`gh pr checkout` + `git push` with a least-
     privilege token), or
   - if that is too invasive, posts a single PR comment with the exact
     `uv lock` / `uv export` commands a maintainer must run locally.
2. Until #1 lands, **do not** merge any pip Dependabot PR by clicking the
   GitHub button — apply the bump locally per
   [`.cursor/skills/dependabot-recommendations/SKILL.md`](../../../.cursor/skills/dependabot-recommendations/SKILL.md), §3-5
   (operator workflow already documented).

> **Doctrine link:** This is the same posture as
> [`THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md`](../inspirations/THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md) §3 — the failure must produce a
> **diagnostic**, not a silent merge. CI is doing its job; the gap is at
> the Dependabot step, before CI runs.

## 3. Per-PR audit (only Medium+ findings)

Format per the protocol: `[Severity] | [Issue] | [Impact]`. PRs with **no
Medium+ findings** are recorded as such for traceability — that is the
protocol's "leave no comments" outcome at the PR level, with the audit
trail kept here.

### 3.1 PR #224 — `deps(pip): bump cryptography from 46.0.7 to 47.0.0`

- **CI status:** ❌ red on Lint, Tests (3.12 and 3.13), Dependency audit, SBOM. SonarCloud skipped.
- **Diff scope:** `requirements.txt` only (51 added / 44 removed, all `--hash=` lines for the new release).
- **Lockfile drift:** **yes** (§2.1 applies).
- **Findings:**
  - **[Medium] | Major-version jump on the project's primary cryptography primitive without a code-path audit | `cryptography` 47.0.0 changes deprecation surface (e.g. legacy hazmat APIs and PSS/OAEP defaults) used downstream by `msoffcrypto-tool` and our `webauthn` integration. A green CI is the contract before a maintainer believes "patch is safe."** Until §2.1 is fixed, the green CI signal does not exist for this PR. Mitigation: bump locally per the dependabot-recommendations skill, run `uv run pytest -v -W error` (warnings-as-errors will surface any new `CryptographyDeprecationWarning`), and keep the cross-version pin floor at `>=46.0.5` until 47.x has at least one `data-boar` release on Hub.
  - **[Low — informational] | Hash list does not include the platform-specific abi3 wheel hash for our default build matrix | Forces source-compile fallback on edge platforms.** Will fix itself when §2.1's auto-export step runs `uv export` on the merge candidate.

### 3.2 PR #222 — `deps(pip): bump chardet from 5.2.0 to 7.4.3`

- **CI status:** ❌ red on Lint, Tests, Dependency audit, SBOM (same root as §2.1).
- **Diff scope:** `requirements.txt` only (35 hash lines for the new wheel set, 2 hashes for the old version removed).
- **Findings:**
  - **[Medium] | Two major-version jumps on a parser that runs on **untrusted customer input** | `chardet` is on the **first line of the fallback hierarchy** in [`THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md`](../inspirations/THE_ART_OF_THE_FALLBACK.md) §2 (encoding detection on Tier-1 data soup). Releases between 5.x and 7.x changed the prober ordering and added new code-page heuristics; a regression here would silently degrade `parser_sql → regex → raw_string` audit decisions for ambiguous CSV/CR-LF dumps. Mitigation: bump locally, then run the connector and file-scan suites (`tests/test_filesystem_connector.py`, `tests/test_dialect_detection.py` if present) under `-W error`. Re-roll the Dependabot PR after §2.1 lands.
  - **[Low — informational] | Transitive `cyclonedx-bom` is the only direct user of `chardet` per `requirements.txt` annotation.** Confirms a *narrow* blast radius once tests pass.

### 3.3 PR #223 — `deps(pip): bump tzdata from 2025.3 to 2026.2`

- **CI status:** ❌ red on Lint, Tests, Dependency audit (lockfile drift only).
- **Diff scope:** 2-line hash swap in `requirements.txt`.
- **Findings:** **none Medium+.** `tzdata` carries no executable code; risk is "wrong DST table" rather than RCE/AuthZ. Hold only because §2.1 must be fixed before CI can give a real ✅.

### 3.4 PR #221 — `deps(pip): bump the pip-minor-patch group across 1 directory with 35 updates`

- **CI status:** ❌ red on Lint, Tests, SBOM (lockfile drift).
- **Diff scope:** 1238 added / 769 removed, **only** `requirements.txt`.
- **Findings:**
  - **[Medium] | Batched group PR hides per-package risk | A 35-package roll-up makes per-package threat modeling impossible inside one PR review pass; this is precisely what the `pip-minor-patch` group config was designed to do, but it must be paired with §2.1 so a maintainer at least sees a **green** CI before merging. Until §2.1 lands, splitting this PR is **not** worth the toil — re-trigger after the lockfile auto-sync workflow exists.
  - **[Low — informational] | No new direct dependency added.** Confirmed by reading the diff: every `==` change in `requirements.txt` corresponds to a `>=` floor that already exists in `pyproject.toml`. So the supply-chain *graph* is unchanged; only versions move.

### 3.5 PR #226 — `chore(deps): bump pyo3 from 0.23.5 to 0.24.1` (cargo)

- **CI status:** ✅ all green (Analyze, Bandit, CodeQL, Dependency audit, Lint, Semgrep, Sonar, Tests 3.12 + 3.13).
- **Diff scope:** `rust/boar_fast_filter/Cargo.lock` + `rust/boar_fast_filter/Cargo.toml` only.
- **Findings:** **none Medium+.** `pyo3` 0.24 is a documented compatible bump for our `extension-module` use; `target-lexicon 0.13` is the only transitive change and is build-time only. The Python `uv.lock` is untouched, so §2.1 does not apply.
- **Recommendation:** **eligible for merge** under the existing autonomous-merge contract (`agent-autonomous-merge-and-lab-ops.mdc`), once a maintainer confirms there is no parallel ABI work pending on the Rust crate.

## 4. Cross-cuts — what this audit does **not** find

Per the protocol I explicitly looked for, and did **not** find, evidence of:

- **Injection** (SQL, command, log) introduced by any of these diffs.
- **Authn / Authz bypass** in code paths touched by these PRs (none of the
  diffs touch `core/`, `api/`, `connectors/`, or `webauthn` code).
- **Secret leakage** or new logging of PII / API keys (no new logging in
  any diff).
- **SSRF / Path traversal / unsafe deserialization** new code paths (no
  net-new Python code; only version pins move).
- **Supply-chain risk introduced by the change** beyond §2.1 — the new
  hashes are signed by the upstream maintainers and resolved by `uv` from
  the same registry already pinned in [ADR 0005](../../adr/0005-ci-github-actions-supply-chain-pins.md).

## 5. Action items (for a maintainer)

| # | Action | Priority | Owner | Reference |
| - | ------ | -------- | ----- | --------- |
| 1 | Land a Dependabot post-step that runs `uv lock` + `uv export` and either commits to the bot branch or comments the exact commands. | **P1** | Maintainer | §2.1, [SKILL.md](../../../.cursor/skills/dependabot-recommendations/SKILL.md) §3 |
| 2 | Merge **PR #226** (cargo / pyo3) — independent of §2.1. | P2 | Maintainer | §3.5 |
| 3 | After §2.1 lands, re-trigger Dependabot rebase on **#221, #222, #223, #224**; review `cryptography` and `chardet` against §3.1 and §3.2 specifically. | P2 | Maintainer | §3.1, §3.2 |
| 4 | Add a regression test that fails if a future Dependabot PR mutates `requirements.txt` *without* a matching `uv.lock` change in the same commit. | P3 | Maintainer | §2.1, doctrinal § "diagnostic on fall" |
