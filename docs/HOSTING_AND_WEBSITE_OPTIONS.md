# Hosting options: private repositories and public website

This memo supports the **Licensing, Enforcement, and GTM** program: where to host private issuer tooling, commercial modules, and a public marketing site. **Costs are indicative (2025–2026); confirm on each vendor’s pricing page.**

## Private source (issuer tooling, commercial modules)

| Option | Access control | Indicative cost | Notes |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| **GitHub private repo** (personal or org) | Invite-only; branch protection; 2FA | **Free** on personal; **Team ~$4/user/mo** (org) | Fits `tools/license-studio` copied to a **separate private repo**; never push signing keys. |
| **GitHub Enterprise** | SSO, audit, IP allow | **Enterprise pricing** | When you need enterprise compliance features. |
| **GitLab** (gitlab.com private group) | Per-group permissions | **Free** tier limited; **Premium** paid tiers for advanced compliance | Good if you prefer GitLab CI. |
| **Self-hosted Forgejo / Gitea** | You operate network ACL | **VPS ~$5–25/mo** + ops time | Air-gappable; you patch the server. |

**Recommendation:** Start with **GitHub private repositories** under your existing org; keep the **issuer** repo off the public `data-boar` tree and never commit keys or blobs.

## Public website (pitch, contact, screenshots)

| Option | Indicative cost | Notes |
| ------ | --------------- | ----- |
| **Cloudflare Pages** + DNS | **Free** tier often sufficient; Pro ~$20/mo | Static site from Git; global CDN. |
| **GitHub Pages** | **Free** for public repos | Simple; tie to a `www` repo. |
| **Netlify / Vercel** | **Free** hobby tiers | Similar to Cloudflare Pages. |
| **Managed WordPress / Webflow** | ~$10–30/mo+ | Less engineer-friendly for “docs as code.” |

**Recommendation:** **Cloudflare Pages** or **GitHub Pages** for a static site; keep **canonical product truth** in the main app repo README/pitch; mirror short copy on the site with a **contact form** or `mailto:` / Calendly link.

## Contact and sales

- Put **one clear CTA** on the site: contact email, form, or booking link.
- Do **not** embed licensing secrets or issuer URLs in the public site.
