# Plan: Additional detection techniques and false-negative reduction

**Status:** In progress (priorities 1–3 implemented; priority 4 ongoing: `connector_format_id_hint` + `FORMAT_LENGTH_HINT_ID` / `FORMAT_TYPE_HINT_ID_INT` / `FORMAT_LENGTH_HINT_EMAIL` (email lengths include 128/191/256 among others); **UUID 32/36** name-token hints added; priority 5: `embedding_prototype_hint` implemented)
**Goal:** Explore techniques, frameworks, and libraries (beyond Regex, ML, and DL) to improve report quality, with emphasis on **reducing false negatives** (missed PII) even at the cost of more false positives (which can be handled later by human review).

## Current detection stack (recap)

| Layer     | Technology                                                                    | Role                                                                                              |
| -------   | ------------                                                                  | ------                                                                                            |
| **Regex** | Built-in + `regex_overrides_file`                                             | Strong pattern match (CPF, SSN, email, credit card, etc.) → HIGH. Runs first.                     |
| **ML**    | TF-IDF + RandomForest (`ml_patterns_file` / `sensitivity_detection.ml_terms`) | Column name + sample text → confidence 0–100; thresholds 70→HIGH, 40→MEDIUM.                      |
| **DL**    | Sentence-transformers + LogisticRegression (`dl_patterns_file` / `dl_terms`)  | Semantic similarity on same (text, label) terms; confidence combined with ML via **max(ml, dl)**. |

Combined logic: regex wins when matched; otherwise `combined_confidence = max(ml_confidence, dl_confidence)`; ambiguous column names (e.g. `doc_id`) → MEDIUM + PII_AMBIGUOUS with “confirm manually”. Entertainment context (lyrics/tabs) and weak patterns are downgraded to reduce false positives.

---

## Principles

- **False negatives are worse than false positives** in this context: missed PII can lead to compliance gaps and regulatory punishment; extra findings can be reviewed by a human. **Balance: prefer a few false positives and ask for human confirmation rather than a false negative and a violation we missed.**
- **When inferring from incomplete or aggregated data**, bias toward flagging for human confirmation rather than dismissing. Regulatory risk of a missed violation outweighs the cost of extra review.
- New techniques should be **additive** where possible (optional engines, config flags) so existing deployments are unchanged.
- Any new path must be **verifiable**: we need a way to measure FN/FP (e.g. synthetic fixtures with ground truth, or spot audits).
- Prefer **simple, explainable** additions first; heavier AI/APIs only if justified by measurable FN reduction.

## Additional techniques (beyond Regex, ML, DL)

### 1. Rule-based / knowledge expansion (low risk, high value)

| Technique                               | Description                                                                                                | FN reduction idea                                                              | FP risk                                      | Feasibility                                                                                               |
| -----------                             | -------------                                                                                              | -------------------                                                            | ---------                                    | -------------                                                                                             |
| **Synonym / alias lists**               | Expand ML/DL terms with regional synonyms and nicknames (e.g. “carte bleue”, “doc_id” → confirm manually). | Catch columns named with local or informal terms.                              | Low if terms are scoped (e.g. ID-like only). | ✅ Already partially in place (DEFAULT_ML_TERMS, AMBIGUOUS_COLUMN_TOKENS). Extend via config.              |
| **Column-name dictionaries per region** | Optional YAML: locale/region → list of (column_name_pattern, category).                                    | Better coverage for FR, DE, ES, PT-BR, etc., without bloating global ML terms. | Low.                                         | ✅ Config-driven; no code change to detector logic beyond loading and applying.                            |
| **Stemming / normalisation**            | Normalise column names (e.g. stem, remove accents) before ML/vocabulary match.                             | “telefones”, “telefoni” → match “telefone”.                                    | Slight (similar tokens might collide).       | ✅ Use a small library (e.g. `stemming`, or simple strip-accents); apply only to column name for matching. |

**Recommendation:** Prioritise **region-specific column dictionaries** and **stemming/normalisation** for column names; keep as optional config so default behaviour is unchanged.

### 2. Fuzzy and typo-tolerant matching (medium value)

| Technique                     | Description                                                                                                                             | FN reduction idea                           | FP risk                                                    | Feasibility                                                                                                               |
| -----------                   | -------------                                                                                                                           | -------------------                         | ---------                                                  | -------------                                                                                                             |
| **Fuzzy column name match**   | Compare column name to sensitive terms with edit distance or token overlap (e.g. `rapidfuzz`, `python-Levenshtein`).                    | “documnet_id”, “telefone_cel” → still flag. | Medium (generic names like “id” could match).              | ✅ Optional post-step: if ML/DL confidence &lt; threshold but fuzzy score above a limit → MEDIUM “possible PII – confirm”. |
| **Token/substring allowlist** | Flag columns that contain tokens from a small “suspicious” set (e.g. “cpf”, “email”, “phone”) even with typo (e.g. “emial”, “telefne”). | Catches typos in column names.              | Medium; constrain to known PII tokens and high similarity. | ✅ Same as above; use high similarity threshold to limit FP.                                                               |

**Recommendation:** Add an **optional** “fuzzy column match” step: only when **no** regex match and ML/DL confidence in a band (e.g. 25–45). If column name is very similar to a known sensitive term → MEDIUM with pattern e.g. `FUZZY_COLUMN_MATCH`. Library: `rapidfuzz` (optional dependency).

### 3. Schema and metadata signals (low FP, good for FN)

| Technique                            | Description                                                                                  | FN reduction idea                                                                                             | FP risk                                                          | Feasibility                                                                                                            |
| -----------                          | -------------                                                                                | -------------------                                                                                           | ---------                                                        | -------------                                                                                                          |
| **Data type + length heuristics**    | e.g. String length in “typical CPF/email range”, or “all digits” + length.                   | Suggest “possible identifier” when format is plausible even if regex didn’t match (e.g. masked or malformed). | Low if used only to **suggest** MEDIUM / review.                 | ✅ Connectors already have sample values; add optional “format hint” (digits_only, length, etc.) to detector or report. |
| **Foreign key / table name context** | If column is FK to a “users” / “people” table, or table name suggests “customer”, “patient”. | Elevate confidence or add “possible PII” when context suggests person-related.                                | Low if we only **boost** existing MEDIUM or add a “review” flag. | ⚠️ Requires schema/metadata from connector (SQL already has this; filesystem would need conventions).                  |
| **Uniqueness / cardinality**         | High uniqueness (e.g. unique count ≈ row count) on a string column.                          | Columns that behave like identifiers but have generic names could be flagged for review.                      | Medium (many non-PII columns are unique).                        | ⚠️ Needs extra scan or statistics; possible as optional “post-scan” or second pass.                                    |

**Recommendation:** Start with **data type + length** as an optional hint (e.g. “looks like numeric id” or “length consistent with email”) and use it only to **suggest MEDIUM** or “confirm manually”. FK/table context is high value where available (SQL); document as optional enhancement for connectors that can expose schema.

### 4. Ensemble and voting (maximise recall)

| Technique                    | Description                                                                                                                                                              | FN reduction idea                                     | FP risk                                                      | Feasibility                                                                                                                                      |
| -----------                  | -------------                                                                                                                                                            | -------------------                                   | ---------                                                    | -------------                                                                                                                                    |
| **“Any engine says HIGH”**   | Today we already use max(ml_confidence, dl_confidence). Extend: if **any** optional engine (e.g. fuzzy, format hint) says “sensitive”, combine with OR or weighted vote. | Reduces FN when one engine misses.                    | Higher FP by design; acceptable if human review is in place. | ✅ Design: add optional engines that return a 0–100 score or a boolean “suggest_sensitive”; combine with existing combined_confidence (e.g. max). |
| **Lower MEDIUM threshold**   | e.g. 35 instead of 40 for MEDIUM.                                                                                                                                        | More borderline cases get human review.               | More MEDIUM findings.                                        | ✅ Single config knob (e.g. `sensitivity_detection.medium_confidence_threshold`).                                                                 |
| **“Suspicious column” list** | Columns matching heuristics (e.g. `*_id`, `*_num`, `*_number`) that were classified LOW → optional second pass or flag in report as “Suggested review”.                  | Surfaces possible identifiers that no engine flagged. | Low if we only **suggest** and do not change LOW to HIGH.    | ✅ Report-only or optional second pass with stricter ML/term list.                                                                                |

**Recommendation:** Implement **configurable MEDIUM threshold** and a **“suggested review”** list in the report (columns that look like IDs but got LOW) as low-effort, high-transparency improvements. Keep “any engine says HIGH” as the existing max(ml, dl) and document that adding more engines will follow the same “max” policy to avoid FN.

### 5. NLP / NER and external APIs (higher effort, optional)

| Technique                                           | Description                                                                                                                    | FN reduction idea                                                  | FP risk                                      | Feasibility                                                                                            |
| -----------                                         | -------------                                                                                                                  | -------------------                                                | ---------                                    | -------------                                                                                          |
| **Named-entity recognition (NER)**                  | Use a pre-trained NER model (e.g. spaCy, or a small transformer) on **sample values** to detect person names, locations, orgs. | Catch names and other entities in free text that ML/DL might miss. | Medium (fiction, place names).               | ⚠️ Optional extra dependency; run only on sample text; best as **optional** engine with config switch. |
| **Presidio or similar PII APIs**                    | Call external or local Presidio (or AWS Comprehend, etc.) on sample text.                                                      | Strong at structured PII in text.                                  | Depends on API; usually tuned for precision. | ⚠️ Network/local API; privacy and latency; good for “audit mode” or optional enrichment.               |
| **Embedding similarity to a “sensitive” prototype** | One vector per category (e.g. “PII”, “health”) from DL embedder; compare column+sample embedding to prototypes.                | Semantic match without training a classifier.                      | Medium.                                      | ✅ Reuse existing sentence-transformers embedder; no new deps; optional.                                |

**Recommendation:** **Embedding prototype similarity** is the most aligned with current stack (reuse DL embedder); add as optional “semantic hint” that can elevate MEDIUM. NER and Presidio: document as **future options** and implement only if FN metrics justify (e.g. after synthetic fixtures and validation).

### 6. Human-in-the-loop and continuous improvement

| **Uncertainty sampling**                    | Flag findings in confidence band (e.g. 40–60) for “operator review”; use confirmations/corrections to feed back into ML/DL terms (learned_patterns). | Improves future runs.                       | N/A.      | ✅ Already have learned_patterns; add explicit “uncertainty” band in report and doc “merge learned_patterns into ml_patterns_file”. |
| **Ground-truth fixtures and FN/FP metrics** | Synthetic (and optionally real) datasets with labels; run detector and compute precision/recall per pattern or per run.                              | Drives which techniques actually reduce FN. | N/A.      | ✅ See PLAN_SYNTHETIC_DATA_AND_CONFIDENCE_VALIDATION.md; use same fixtures to validate new engines.                                 |

**Recommendation:** Treat **learned_patterns** and **ground-truth validation** as the backbone for measuring and improving FN: any new technique should be evaluated on the same fixtures and show a measurable recall improvement.

## Inference on aggregated and incomplete data

We already infer personal or sensitive data under LGPD/GDPR/CCPA etc. from an **incomplete set**: column names plus a **sample** of values (e.g. `sample_limit` rows), not the full population. Aggregation then groups findings by table or file and infers **“possible identification”** when multiple quasi-identifier categories (gender, health, phone, address, other) appear together in the same group. That inference is therefore uncertain: we may miss columns that are PII but didn’t show up in the sample, or we may under-count categories and miss a high-risk combination.

## Policy for aggregated and incomplete inference:
Prefer **more false positives and human confirmation** over **false negatives and regulatory punishment**. When in doubt, flag as “possible” / “suggested review” so the operator can confirm, rather than dismissing and risking a violation.

### Tactics to improve aggregated/incomplete inference (FN‑first balance)

| **Conservative category mapping**                            | When a finding could map to more than one quasi-identifier category, or the pattern is weak/ambiguous, still map it to at least one category (e.g. `other`) so it counts toward aggregation. Avoid “no category” when the column name or pattern is suggestive.                                                                                              | Tables with borderline columns still get flagged if they reach min_categories.                                                                             | Slight: more groups may reach threshold.                                                   |
| **Lower bar when data is incomplete**                        | Optional config: when `sample_limit` is low or coverage is known partial (e.g. only some tables scanned), allow **lower `aggregated_min_categories`** (e.g. 1 for high-risk categories like health) or a dedicated “incomplete data” mode that flags more groups as “suggested review”.                                                                      | Reduces FN when we have few samples per column.                                                                                                            | More aggregated rows; report should state “based on incomplete sample – confirm manually”. |
| **Single high-risk category can trigger “suggested review”** | Optionally, when a group has only one category but it is high-risk (e.g. health, or multiple columns in “other” that look like identifiers), still produce a row with sensitivity “suggested review” or MEDIUM so the operator sees it.                                                                                                                      | Catches tables that would otherwise need exactly two categories but only one was detected due to incomplete data.                                          | Configurable; report wording clarifies “possible” risk.                                    |
| **Report wording and transparency**                          | In the “Cross-referenced data – possible identification” sheet and recommendations, state explicitly that results are **based on sampled/incomplete data** and **human confirmation is recommended**. Use “possible”, “suggested”, “may allow identification” so we never imply certainty when we only had a sample.                                         | Builds trust and ensures operators don’t treat low-sample findings as definitive; reduces risk of acting as if we had no PII when we might have missed it. | None.                                                                                      |
| **Include MEDIUM and PII_AMBIGUOUS in aggregation**          | Ensure findings classified as MEDIUM or pattern PII_AMBIGUOUS still contribute to category mapping (e.g. map to `other`) and count toward `min_categories`. Do not exclude them from aggregation.                                                                                                                                                            | Avoids missing a table that only had “doc_id”‑style columns and no strong regex match.                                                                     | Already aligned with “confirm manually”; may add more aggregated rows.                     |
| **Optional “incomplete data” mode**                          | Config flag (e.g. `detection.aggregated_incomplete_data_mode: true`): when set, (1) use a lower threshold for per-column MEDIUM for aggregation purposes only, and/or (2) lower `aggregated_min_categories` by 1 (min 1), and (3) add a note in the report that findings are based on incomplete data and all flagged groups should be confirmed by a human. | Maximises recall when the operator knows coverage is partial.                                                                                              | More findings; acceptable under the FN‑first balance.                                      |

**Recommendation:** Implement **report wording and transparency** first (no logic change, just text). Then ensure **MEDIUM and PII_AMBIGUOUS contribute to aggregation** (already the case if they map to a category; verify and document). Add **optional “incomplete data” mode** and **single high-risk category “suggested review”** as config-driven options so deployments that must minimise regulatory risk can opt in.

## Implementation priorities (recommended order)

1. **Configurable MEDIUM threshold** and **“suggested review”** (report) for ID-like columns classified LOW — minimal code, immediate value.
1. **Stemming/normalisation** for column names in ML/term matching — **done (slice 2):** optional `sensitivity_detection.column_name_normalize_for_ml` applies **accent folding + separator normalisation** to the column name **for ML/DL input only** (`core/column_name_normalize.py`); not full Porter stemming. See `docs/SENSITIVITY_DETECTION.md`.
1. **Optional fuzzy column name match** (e.g. rapidfuzz), only in 25–45 confidence band, → MEDIUM + FUZZY_COLUMN_MATCH — **done:** `sensitivity_detection.fuzzy_column_match` + optional extra `detection-fuzzy`; see `docs/SENSITIVITY_DETECTION.md`, `core/fuzzy_column_match.py`.
1. **Data type / length hint** from connectors → optional “format hint” in detector and MEDIUM suggestion when format suggests identifier but no regex hit — **done (ongoing slices):** `sensitivity_detection.connector_format_id_hint` + `FORMAT_LENGTH_HINT_ID` / `FORMAT_TYPE_HINT_ID_INT` / `FORMAT_LENGTH_HINT_EMAIL`; SQL `CHAR`/`VARCHAR(N)` length parsed from connector metadata; conservative name heuristics (CPF/CNPJ/SSN; **UUID** `VARCHAR(36)` / hex `VARCHAR(32)` when column name contains `uuid`, `guid`, or `uniqueidentifier`); wired through `DataScanner.scan_column` / SQL, Snowflake, Dataverse, Power BI, SQLite-in-file path in filesystem connector. **Email-length hint** extended to common schema sizes (**128, 191, 254, 255, 256, 320**) with existing email-like name tokens. Further work: more connectors without schema types.
1. **Embedding prototype similarity** (reuse DL embedder) as optional “semantic hint” to elevate MEDIUM.
1. **Region-specific column dictionaries** (config) and, where connector supports it, **FK/table context**.
1. NER / Presidio as **optional, documented** extensions once fixtures and FN metrics are in place.

## Aggregated and incomplete-data inference (FN-first balance)

1. **Report wording and transparency**: in aggregated sheet and recommendations, state that results are based on sampled/incomplete data and human confirmation is recommended; use "possible", "suggested", "may allow identification".
1. **Verify MEDIUM and PII_AMBIGUOUS contribute to aggregation** (map to category and count toward min_categories); document behaviour.
1. **Optional "incomplete data" mode**: config flag to lower aggregated_min_categories when coverage is partial and add report note that all flagged groups should be confirmed by a human.
1. **Optional single high-risk category "suggested review"**: when a group has only one category but it is high-risk (e.g. health), still produce a row with "suggested review" so the operator sees it.

## Verification plan (how to confirm it works)

1. **Define a small ground-truth set**
   - Use or extend the synthetic/fixture approach from PLAN_SYNTHETIC_DATA_AND_CONFIDENCE_VALIDATION.
   - Include: clear PII (CPF, email, names), clear non-PII (counts, logs), and **intentional FN** (e.g. misspelled column names, masked values, regional nicknames).

1. **Baseline**
   - Run current detector (regex + ML + DL) on the set; record per-column sensitivity and pattern.
   - Compute recall (how many of the known PII columns were flagged as HIGH or MEDIUM).

1. **Per-technique validation**
   - Enable one new technique at a time (e.g. fuzzy match, or lower MEDIUM threshold).
   - Re-run and compare recall and precision.
   - Accept a technique if recall increases and precision stays acceptable (or FP are documented as “review”).

1. **Regression**
   - Ensure existing tests still pass; add tests for new code paths and for “no change when optional feature off”.

1. **Documentation**
   - Document each optional technique in `docs/SENSITIVITY_DETECTION.md`: when it runs, how to enable/disable, and how it affects FN/FP.

| Aggregated / incomplete-data inference (conservative mapping, incomplete-data mode, report wording) | ✅ Yes       | Config and report text; optional lower bar when data is incomplete.   |

Overall: **yes, it is possible** to add several techniques that improve quality and reduce false negatives. The safest and most measurable path is: (1) configurable thresholds and “suggested review”, (2) stemming and optional fuzzy match, (3) format/schema hints, (4) embedding prototype, (5) region dictionaries and FK context; then NER/APIs if metrics justify.

All new dependencies should be **optional** (extras in pyproject.toml, e.g. `[detection-fuzzy]`) so default install and CI remain light.
