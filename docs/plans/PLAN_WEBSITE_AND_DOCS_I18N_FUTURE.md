# Plan (future): public website, marketing depth, and extra doc languages

**Status:** ⬜ **Reminder / backlog** — not scheduled. Revisit when the product is **closer to production-ready** (e.g. after **M-LAB**, stable **M-TRUST**, and a clear GTM slice).

**Purpose:** Capture intent so we do not forget: a **stronger public surface** (site + optional extra languages) aligned with **branding** (Data Boar / dashBOARd, data soup narrative) and **trust** (releases, docs, use cases).

---

## 1. Documentation in additional human languages

- **Today:** User-facing docs are **English (canonical)** + **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)** per [docs-policy](../../.cursor/rules/docs-policy.mdc).
- **Later (evaluate):** Add languages that match **markets or compliance narratives** you care about — e.g. **Spanish (es)** for LatAm, **Japanese (ja)** if there is a concrete channel or partner demand. Each new language implies **ongoing sync** cost with EN; treat as a **deliberate** decision, not a one-off translation burst.
- **Mechanics (when ready):** Mirror the existing EN ↔ pt-BR pattern: language switchers, index rows in `docs/README.md`, and a rule for which files are translated (product docs yes; `docs/plans/` may stay EN-only).

---

## 2. Full descriptive / marketing website (possibly multilingual)

**Goal:** A **dedicated site** (not only GitHub README) for **discovery**, **pitch**, and **credibility** — similar in *role* to how serious projects present themselves (e.g. **FreeBSD**, **Ubuntu**, **Snort**, **pfSense**): clear value prop, downloads/releases, docs entry points, and community or commercial CTA. **Form** (static vs CMS, exact layout) is TBD; **content pillars** should include:

| Pillar                | Notes                                                                                                                      |
| ------                | -----                                                                                                                      |
| **Pitch**             | Decision-maker narrative; optional **longer** “deep pitch” page.                                                           |
| **Use cases**         | Sectors, scan/report stories, compliance framing (without overclaiming).                                                   |
| **How-tos**           | Short guided paths that link into **canonical** `docs/` (USAGE, DEPLOY) so we do not fork truth.                           |
| **Documentation hub** | Links or embedded paths to **version-synced** docs (same major/minor as releases).                                         |
| **Releases**          | Prominent links to **GitHub Releases**, **Docker Hub** tags, and `docs/releases/`.                                         |
| **Branding**          | Mascot, dashBOARd sub-brand, visual consistency with [COPYRIGHT_AND_TRADEMARK.md](../COPYRIGHT_AND_TRADEMARK.md) guidance. |

**Hosting:** See [HOSTING_AND_WEBSITE_OPTIONS.md](../HOSTING_AND_WEBSITE_OPTIONS.md) (static site options). Keep **no secrets** on the public site.

**i18n on the site:** If the site is multilingual, define **which locales** ship first and how they stay aligned with EN source copy (same discipline as repo docs).

### 2.1 Website vs pitch deck vs GitHub docs — **depth contract** (not scheduled yet)

**We are not building the public website now** — this subsection is a **planning memory** so GTM work does not collapse everything into one surface.

**Rule of thumb:** If a buyer **needs to install, tune, or audit** behaviour, that content **lives on the future site (or linked canonical docs)** — not in the pitch deck or the compliance-legal **summary** tone of the presentation.

### 2.2 Same multilingual “tricks” as **dashBOARd**

When the site ships, **reuse the same i18n design choices** planned for the dashboard HTML surface — see [PLAN_DASHBOARD_I18N.md](PLAN_DASHBOARD_I18N.md): **path-prefixed** locales (e.g. `/en/`, `/pt-br/`), **cookie → `Accept-Language` → configured fallback**, **JSON** message catalogs (or mirrored pattern for static site generators), and **CI key parity** across locale files where applicable. **D-WEB** / **M-LOCALE-V1** remain the **product** implementation; the **marketing site** should **not invent a conflicting** locale scheme.

### 2.3 Presentation refresh ↔ website readiness (cadence cue)

- As **capabilities** grow (new connectors, report types, governance features), expect to produce a **new stakeholder presentation pair** (e.g. refreshed `.pptx` or `slides.yaml` **EN + pt-BR** under `docs/private/pitch/`).
- **Heuristic:** when you **rewrite the pitch** for a new selling story, treat it as a **trigger** to **schedule** (not necessarily ship immediately) a **website content pass**: roadmap section, release links, technical hub TOC, and “what’s new” — so the **public** story does not lag the **private** deck.
- **pt-BR copy** in the deck (and later on the **public** `pt-br/` site) should follow **Brazilian** Portuguese, not European forms — same bar as **`*.pt_BR.md`** (see **`.cursor/rules/docs-pt-br-locale.mdc`**). If `slides.yaml` or flattened **`SLIDES_WEBSITE_SYNC.pt_BR.md`** ever live in **tracked** paths, extend **`tests/test_docs_pt_br_locale.py`** (`_extra_locale_scan_paths`) so CI catches regressions.
- The **website** remains the **deep** layer; the **presentation** stays **derivative and shallow-technical**, seeded from the same brand narrative.

## 3. Dependencies and sequencing (high level)

1. **Stable product story** — version cadence, support posture, and what we promise publicly.
1. **Legal / trademark** — counsel pass on public claims and name use where needed.
1. **Content owner** — who approves site copy and translations.
1. **Automation** — optional CI to publish from a `website/` repo or branch; link checker for docs URLs.

## 5. When to activate

Promote this from “reminder” to a **sprint-sized** initiative when:

- Homelab / second-environment confidence is in a good state (**–1L** / **M-LAB**), and
- Priority band **A** hygiene is not blocking, and
- You have bandwidth for **ongoing** translation + site maintenance.

Until then, **no obligation** to implement; this file is the **memory hook**.
