# Portfolio and evidence sources (thesis, pitch, CV narrative)

**Purpose:** Single place to list **where** to get (or add) evidence for thesis, compliance narrative, and pitch. Keeps sessions token-efficient: open this file + one source at a time. See [TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md](TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md) §3 for how this ties into plans.

**Policy:** Public URLs and repo paths only. No sensitive or private content here; private docs stay in `docs/private/` (git-ignored) and are referenced by filename.

## 0. Stakeholder pitch — keep in sync with README

**Canonical copy** for decision-makers lives in the root **[README.md](../../README.md)** and **[README.pt_BR.md](../../README.pt_BR.md)** (*For decision-makers / Para gestores*). When you refresh decks, CV blurbs, or thesis “product” paragraphs, start there.

## Differentiators to cite (hireability / commercial story):

- **Filesystem judgment:** Configurable plain-text depth plus **calmer ML triage** on entertainment-shaped and common OSS-doc content—**review band** vs **priority** violations—so legal and DPO time goes to real risk.
- **Roadmap — richer data soup:** Optional **image metadata and OCR**, **audio/video** tags, **subtitle** sidecars ([PLAN_ADDITIONAL_DATA_SOUP_FORMATS.md](PLAN_ADDITIONAL_DATA_SOUP_FORMATS.md), [USAGE.md](../../USAGE.md))—same **boar / soup** metaphor for media-heavy estates.
- **Roadmap — enterprise extensions:** **SAP** plus **HR / SST / ERP / CRM**-class systems (research-first integration patterns: [PLAN_SAP_CONNECTOR.md](PLAN_SAP_CONNECTOR.md), [PLAN_ENTERPRISE_HR_SST_ERP_CONNECTORS.md](PLAN_ENTERPRISE_HR_SST_ERP_CONNECTORS.md)).
- **Roadmap — operability:** **Scan-complete notifications** ([PLAN_NOTIFICATIONS_OFFBAND_AND_SCAN_COMPLETE.md](PLAN_NOTIFICATIONS_OFFBAND_AND_SCAN_COMPLETE.md)); **identity / subscription-ready** access for multi-operator deploys (**M-ACCESS**, [SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.md](SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.md)).

Tags e.g. `1.6.0`, `latest`. | Short description on Hub; full description with quick start and link to GitHub. Size ~186 MB (1.6.0).                            |
| **wildfly_t1r** | [hub.docker.com/r/fabioleitao/wildfly_t1r](https://hub.docker.com/r/fabioleitao/wildfly_t1r) | **[FabioLeitao/wf_t1r](https://github.com/FabioLeitao/wf_t1r)** (Shell). Dockerfiles live in that repo if you want to paste or link them here later.                            | Archived on Hub. Tag e.g. `et-ojdk8-a_w26.1.1-final`. Eclipse Temurin + Wildfly; Ubuntu/Alpine; OpenJDK 8/11/17/19; Oracle JDBC. |
| **uptk**        | [hub.docker.com/r/fabioleitao/uptk](https://hub.docker.com/r/fabioleitao/uptk)               | No overview on Hub. If you have a repo or Dockerfile for Uptime Kuma, add the link here.                                                                                        | Tag `0.1`, ~3.1 MB. You keep upgrading on the actual server.                                                                     |

**Optional:** You can add a short `docs/private/Dockerfiles_used.md` (or paste Dockerfiles there) for wf_t1r/uptk so thesis or narrative can cite “Dockerfiles created and used” without opening GitHub in every session.

## 3. Certifications and community (for thesis/CV/pitch)

Add only what you are comfortable making reference to in docs; keep wording factual.

#### Public narrative hygiene (LinkedIn, CV, thesis)

- **Safe to cite in public profiles and talks:** institution names, program titles, years, workload (hours), public **edital** or catalog URLs, official **certificate validation** pages (when the issuer publishes a code), and high-level status (e.g. “awaiting convocation,” “in progress”).
- **Do not paste into GitHub, public issues/PRs, or open LinkedIn attachments:** CPF or national ID numbers, full **contract** scans, banking or payment lines, exam **registration** numbers, or unredacted PDFs that combine identity with competition data. Keep those only under **`docs/private/`** (see **`docs/private.example/`** layouts).
- **Dataprev (public competition):** Link to the **FGV concourse hub** and the **official Edital** PDF; describe placement and profile at **CV-level** abstraction. For personal screenshots or PDFs, use **`docs/private/`** and reference by filename in this file—not by pasting document contents here.
- **PUCRS / PUC-Rio:** Cite **course name**, **issuer school**, **hours**, and **validation** instructions the institution already publishes; do not quote **contract** clauses or ID fields in tracked docs.

### 3.0 Study priority window (2026) — paid cyber + product proof first; AI / Anthropic alternating; CCA when eligible

**Intent:** **Cursor** (and whichever models the IDE uses) is the **delivery toolchain** for **this repo**—we do **not** assume the runtime product is “Claude-only.” **Stakeholder proof** stays **shipped Data Boar**, **compliance narrative**, **tests/docs/CI**, **releases**. **Already-paid cyber (CWL)** is the **main** structured cert lane to **finish**—it matches security, audit, and production-hardening story. **Anthropic Academy** (free) is a **useful alternating track** over the year (API, MCP, agent patterns—portable concepts even when the editor uses other providers). **CCA** remains a **later capstone** when Anthropic’s **experience bar** is met; partner perks affect **exam access/pricing**, not the free courses.

**CWL (primary paid lane):** §3.2 — start **BTF → C3SA**, then onward; **alternate** blocks with AI so neither track stalls.

**Suggested weekly cadence (operator-tunable):** **2** blocks **cyber (CWL)** + **1** block **IA** (Anthropic Academy ou outro); na semana seguinte **2** cyber + **1** **outro assunto** (ex.: tese, LGPD, doc de homelab, leitura de plano); **repetir** o ciclo até fechar marcos CWL. Se **faixa A** ou **release** pesarem, reduzir a 1+1 ou só manter o fio fino A.

**Anthropic Academy (secondary / alternating):** [Anthropic courses](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/resources/courses) — [anthropic.skilljar.com](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/). Suggested sequence when you open that lane: **Claude 101** → **Building with the Claude API** → **Introduction to Model Context Protocol** (+ **Advanced** when relevant) → **Claude Code in Action** → **agent skills / subagents**.

**CCA exam (later):** [Claude Certified Architect — Anthropic Academy](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/claude-certified-architect-foundations-access-request); unofficial [guide](https://aitoolsclub.com/how-to-become-a-claude-certified-architect-complete-guide/). Schedule when prep + depth align—no fixed month.

**Optional third-party completion certs** (Cursor/AI on Coursera, Codecademy, etc.): CV polish only—not vendor proctored exams.

**Stakeholder line (short):** *Security and delivery evidence come first (paid cyber progress + shipped product + LGPD posture). AI ecosystem learning runs in parallel at a sustainable cadence; formal AI-vendor exams are a milestone when the bar is met—not the gate for credibility this quarter.*

### 3.1 Certifications and learning – sequenced to-do (production + academic)

Use this when you (re)find **paid but incomplete** certs or want to pick **low-effort, high-gain** certs. Store your list in `docs/private/Learning_and_certs.md` (or similar); this section stays as the sequenced checklist.

| Order | To-do                                                                                | Why (production / academic)                                  |
| ----- | -----                                                                                | ----------------------------                                 |
| 1     | **List paid / incomplete certs** (platform, course name, link if any).               | So we don’t lose track; prioritise by effort vs gain.        |
| 2     | **Prioritise 1–2** as “low effort, high gain” for this cycle.                        | Focus beats scattering; one cert finished > three half-done. |
| 3     | **Complete the chosen cert(s)** and save proof in `docs/private/` (PDF/screenshot).  | Adds to §3 table and CV/thesis narrative.                    |
| 4     | **Update this file** (§3 table) and optional checklist in PLANS_TODO or TOKEN_AWARE. | Keeps portfolio and plans in sync.                           |

**Low-effort, high-gain (suggestions):** Prefer certs that support **both** production readiness and academic narrative: e.g. **LGPD / privacy / DPO awareness** (short courses, many on Udemy/Alura), **ISO 27001/27701 awareness**, **cloud fundamentals** (AWS/GCP/Azure free or low-cost), **security basics** (e.g. CompTIA Security+ prep, or platform-specific). Avoid long, expensive ones unless they’re already paid and near completion. When in doubt, finish one you’ve already paid for before buying new.

**Talent pool (trusted contributors):** Optional **role-archetype** mini-roadmaps (repo onboarding + career-aligned certs, including PUCRS supplements in section 3.3) live in **[`docs/TALENT_POOL_LEARNING_PATHS.md`](../TALENT_POOL_LEARNING_PATHS.md)** — **no** candidate names or LinkedIn data in that file; per-person notes stay under **`docs/private/`**.

**Source:** Screenshots in `docs/private/`: IMG_6491–6499.jpg, signal-2026-03-18-035101.jpeg. Platform: **labs.cyberwarfare.live**. All listed below are marked "On Progress."

| Code        | Course                              | Why it helps (production / academic / certifiable confidence)                                                                                     |
| ----        | ------                              | -------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                     |
| **BTF**     | Blue Team Fundamentals              | Threat detection, incident response, security monitoring. **Foundation** for production readiness and defensive narrative; short, high leverage.  |
| **C3SA**    | Certified Cyber Security Analyst    | SOC analyst: detect threats, investigate incidents, analyze logs. Direct fit for **audit, logging, and certifiable confidence**; strong CV title. |
| **MCBTA**   | Multi-Cloud Blue Team Analyst       | Centralized logging, log analysis, threat detection on AWS/Azure/GCP. Supports **cloud-ready** app narrative and Data Prev / enterprise roles.    |
| **PTF**     | Purple Team Fundamentals            | Core of purple teaming (red + blue). Supports **balanced offensive/defensive** narrative for thesis and PUC-Rio Compliance de Cibersegurança.     |
| **MCRTA**   | Multi-Cloud Red Team Analyst        | Cloud red team, credentials enum/exploit, AWS/Azure/GCP. Complements MCBTA; good for **cloud security** depth and academic breadth.               |
| **CRTA**    | Red Team Analyst                    | Web/network exploitation, AD basics & attacks, pivoting. **Offensive** depth; informs defensive hardening of app and deploy pipeline.             |
| **CRT-ID**  | Red Team Infra Dev                  | OPSEC-safe infra, redirectors, payload servers, cloud/on-prem. Relevant to **secure deploy** (signing, repo, OPSEC) and production infra.         |
| **CRT-COI** | Red Team CredOps Infiltrator        | Windows creds (DPAPI, LSASS), credential dumping. **Defensive** value: understand cred handling for secure config/secrets in app.                 |
| **CPIA**    | Certified Process Injection Analyst | Process injection, persistence, evasion. Informs **app hardening** and "why signed/verified deploy" narrative.                                    |
| **CCSE**    | Cyber Security Engineer             | Broad: 50+ labs, OSINT to internal pentest. Strong **certifiable confidence** and CV; larger scope – do after 1–2 shorter certs.                  |

## How to use these for maximum value (your study, token-aware):

- **Studying is your task;** the agent does not do the learning. Use this section to decide **what** to do and **when**.
- **One cert at a time:** Finish one course fully (proof in `docs/private/`) before starting the next. "One done > three in progress" keeps narrative and CV clear.
- **Recommended order for goals (production + academic + certifiable confidence):**
  1. **BTF** → foundational blue team; fastest impact on "defensive readiness" and incident response.
  1. **C3SA** → SOC analyst; logs and detection; strong title for Data Prev / enterprise and thesis.
  1. **MCBTA** → multi-cloud blue; after BTF/C3SA for cloud and centralized logging narrative.
  1. **PTF** → purple team; bridges red+blue; good for thesis "balanced view" and PUC-Rio alignment.
  1. Then red/advanced as capacity allows: **MCRTA**, **CRTA**, **CRT-ID**, **CRT-COI**, **CPIA**; **CCSE** last or in parallel with one shorter one (broad, 50+ labs).
- **When to slot study in the sequence:** After **Dependabot/Scout** and **one feature slice** (e.g. Content type step 2 or Data source versions Phase 1), allocate **fixed study blocks** (e.g. 1–2 sessions per week). Do not mix deep study with same-day agent-heavy coding; keeps context and tokens manageable.
- **Evidence:** When you complete a CWL cert, save the certificate or completion screenshot to `docs/private/` (e.g. `CWL_BTF_certificate.pdf`) and add a row to §3 table (Certifications and community) so it feeds CV and thesis narrative.

| **Compliance Criminal**                            | Medium: reinforces **Brazilian corporate criminal compliance** narrative; useful when pitching to **legal/compliance** buyers; little impact on code.                                   | High for **jurídico**-weighted thesis chapters (program integrity, accountability).                   | Some overlap with **defensive** mindset (risk, controls); does not replace CWL labs.                      | **2** — after or alongside thesis **background** drafting; avoid same month as heavy release.          |
| **Gestão de Mudança**                              | Medium: **rollout** of Data Boar in enterprises (adoption, resistance, comms); good for **professional services** and **implementation** storyline.                                     | Medium: TCC **discussion** on deploying technical controls in real orgs.                              | Low.                                                                                                      | **3**                                                                                                  |
| **A Escuta dos Excessos**                          | Medium: **ethics, proportionality, limits** of automated scanning — use carefully in **COMPLIANCE** wording; supports “**not exhaustive** / human review” positioning.                  | High if the thesis includes **fundamentos éticos** or **direitos fundamentais** vs surveillance tech. | Low.                                                                                                      | **3–4**                                                                                                |
| **Economia Circular**                              | Lower direct fit unless you frame **data lifecycle**, **retention**, or **ESG** reporting; optional for **sustainability** pitch.                                                       | Low unless advisor wants **ESG × dados** angle.                                                       | Low.                                                                                                      | **5** — only if thesis or employer explicitly values **circular economy** narrative.                   |

**How to slot without a new “plan file”:** Treat PUCRS extensions like §3.1 — **one completion at a time**; store enrolment and proof under **`docs/private/Learning_and_certs.md`**; after each certificate, add a row to the §3 **Certifications and community** table (issuer PUCRS, course title, year). Keep **CWL** as the **primary paid cyber** lane unless you deliberately pause it for a short PUCRS sprint; use the **alternating week’s “other” block** (§3.0) for PUCRS reading/assessment first.

#### PUC-Rio Digital extension courses (lato sensu benefit — verify contract)

**Catalog (public):** [PUC-Rio Digital — Cursos de extensão](https://especializacao.ccec.puc-rio.br/cursos-extensao) — short **Aperfeiçoamento** and **Cursos livres** (often up to ~30h). Titles and availability change; confirm syllabus, price, and schedule on the official page.

**Enrollment terms:** If your **especialização** includes a benefit (e.g. **up to two paid extension courses** and/or a **per-course value cap**), treat this table as **advisory only** until the **coordenação/secretaria** confirms **eligible offerings**, **deadlines**, and whether the cap is **per course** or **aggregate**. Store the **signed contract or PDF** only under **`docs/private/`** (see **`docs/private.example/academic/README.md`**); **do not** commit it to Git.

**Priority (aligned with Data Boar, professional narrative, and TCC):** Favour courses that add **governance / data / secure engineering** language without duplicating your existing deep Python–SRE stack.

| Priority | Offering (name on catalog) | Why |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| **1** | **Curso livre: Gestão e Governança de Dados** | Strong fit for **LGPD / ISO** narrative, inventory and **evidence** story, and **TCC** “fundamentação” — complements the product positioning. |
| **2a** | **Aperfeiçoamento: Qualidade de Software, Segurança e Sistemas Inteligentes** | Covers **quality, secure development, intelligent systems** — maps to hybrid detection, **CI/quality** habits, and defensible engineering claims. |
| **2b** *(alternative to 2a)* | **Curso livre: Desenvolvimento de Software Seguro** | Narrower **AppSec** focus if you prefer explicit secure-development framing over the broader aperfeiçoamento. |
| **3** | **Curso livre: Engenharia de Requisitos e Gestão Ágil de Produtos** | Use if the bottleneck is **product discovery, roadmap, and specs** rather than core cyber or data governance. |
| **Lower marginal gain (unless TCC explicitly needs the citation)** | **Machine Learning e Analytics** / **Curso livre: Machine Learning** | Useful for **formal curriculum alignment** with ML in the thesis; often **redundant** with existing hands-on depth — take only with a clear academic or credential goal. |

**Suggested two-course bundles (if both are contract-eligible and affordable):**

- **Default:** **Gestão e Governança de Dados** + **Qualidade de Software, Segurança e Sistemas Inteligentes**.
- **More AppSec-specific:** **Gestão e Governança de Dados** + **Desenvolvimento de Software Seguro**.

After completion, add a row to the §3 **Certifications and community** table (issuer **PUC-Rio Digital** / **CCEC**, course title, year) and keep receipts in **`docs/private/Learning_and_certs.md`**.

## For in-progress or paid-not-started, add or update `docs/private/Learning_and_certs.md`.

### 4.2 After the lato sensu at PUC-Rio – possible next steps

**Purpose:** Document the option to pursue **another course or track** after finishing the PUC-Rio Compliance de Cibersegurança (lato sensu). Makes sense as a natural continuation for production readiness, certifiable confidence, and academic career.

**Token-aware:** When deciding post-lato, open only this section (and the one plan or program link you are comparing). No need to open all academic plans in one session; pick one option at a time (low complexity / high gain).

| **Universidade do Intercâmbio (Harvard online + mestrado opcional)** | Escola/programa com cursos online de Harvard; possibilidade de mestrado opcional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Cursos online de Harvard](https://www.universidadedointercambio.com/cursos-online-de-harvard/). Add details (modalidade, duração, custo, requisitos do mestrado) to `docs/private/Post_lato_sensu_options.md` when you have them. |
| **Faculdade HUB – MBA em IA (+ Mestrado AGTU opcional)**             | MBA em Transformação de Negócios com IA Generativa (HUB, MEC); dupla titulação opcional com Mestrado em Negócios e IA (AGTU, Flórida). 12 meses, 100% online; sem TCC; inclui trilha de microcertificados Harvard/IBM/Babson, bootcamp presencial em SP (opcional). Pago (12x ou 18x); graduação completa exigida para o mestrado AGTU. | [MBA Inteligência Artificial – Faculdade HUB](https://pv.faculdadehub.com.br/mbaia0002/mba-inteligencia-artificial/).

| **Other course or program**                                          | A second specialization, MBA, or extension you are considering (e.g. another PUC-Rio program, or a different institution).                                                                                                                                                                                                              | When you have the link or name: add a row here and, if useful, a short note in `docs/private/` (e.g. `docs/private/Post_lato_sensu_options.md`) with URL, duration, and how it fits after Compliance de Cibersegurança.            |

**Suggested sequence (if it makes sense for you):** (1) Finish PUC-Rio lato sensu and TCC; (2) then choose one of: stricto sensu (M.Sc. track) per PLAN_STRICTO_SENSU, Universidade do Intercâmbio (Harvard online / mestrado opcional), Faculdade HUB (MBA em IA + mestrado AGTU opcional), or another course you have in mind; (3) CWL certs (BTF, C3SA, etc.) can run in parallel with the lato sensu as capacity allows, and will strengthen the narrative for whichever path you choose next.

## 5. What to get next – recommendations

Use this when you can "try to get" something and want to prioritise. Ordered by **impact on the plans** and **realistic to obtain**.

| Priority | What to get                                            | Why it helps                                                                                                                     | Where to put it                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -----------                                            | ------------                                                                                                                     | -----------------                                                                                                                                        |
| **1**    | **Program / course requirements** (lato sensu)         | If you already have a program or course: official "estrutura do TCC", "critérios de avaliação", or "normas da ABNT" (1–3 pages). | `docs/private/` (e.g. `program_tcc_requirements.pdf`). Then we align thesis outline (PLAN_LATO_SENSU §1.2, §5.2) to it.                                  |
| **2**    | **1–2 redacted report excerpts** (Data Boar)           | One inventory sheet and one heatmap/summary (fake or anonymised data) as PDF or screenshots.                                     | `docs/private/` (e.g. `sample_report_inventory.pdf`, `sample_heatmap.png`). Thesis "case study" and "outputs" (PLAN_LATO_SENSU §4.2) can reference them. |
| **3**    | **Architecture diagram export**                        | TOPOLOGY.md is textual. One visual (Mermaid → PNG/SVG, or draw.io) "high-level components + scan pipeline" for the thesis.       | `docs/` (e.g. `topology-diagram.png`) or thesis folder. PLAN_LATO_SENSU §3.1 needs "1–2 architecture diagrams".                                          |
| **4**    | **Ubuntu / LPIC proof (optional)**                     | Link to your Ubuntu profile or "contributor" page; LPIC-1 (101) certificate scan or link if you want it cited.                   | Add URL or filename to §3 above; no need to commit certificate image.                                                                                    |
| **5**    | **Runbook or backup procedure** (from your experience) | Short "when app is down we check X; when we backup we do Y" (even bullet points).                                                | Paste into a note in `docs/private/` or send in chat; we turn it into the operator runbook and backup/restore text (PLAN_READINESS §4.3).                |
| **6**    | **Scenario one-liners** (case studies)                 | 1–3 sentences per scenario: e.g. "Empresa médio porte BR: 2 DBs PostgreSQL, 1 filesystem, foco LGPD Art. 37".                    | `docs/private/case_study_scenarios.md` or in chat. Feeds PLAN_LATO_SENSU §4.1–4.3.                                                                       |
| **7**    | **LGPD/ISO checklist** (if you have one)               | Any checklist or list of "evidence we need" from a course, employer, or DPO template (generic is fine).                          | `docs/private/` or paste; we map app features to each line (PLAN_COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE_MAPPING).                                                           |
| **8**    | **Dockerfiles** (wf_t1r, uptk)                         | So we can say "Dockerfiles created and used" with a single reference.                                                            | `docs/private/Dockerfiles_used.md` (paste or paths) or ensure they're in the GitHub repos; add link in §1.                                               |

**Not required:** Real customer data, confidential configs, or anything that would expose PII. Anonymised, synthetic, or "inspired by" is enough for thesis and evidence mapping.

### What you said you'll grab – quick checklist

Use this to tick off as you find or add each item. Store files in `docs/private/` unless noted.

*(Optional)* Ubuntu/LPIC proof: add URL or filename to §3; no file needed if you only cite the link.

---

## 6. What else you can add (optional)

- **Dockerfiles:** From wf_t1r or uptk (or a short note in `docs/private/Dockerfiles_used.md`) so “Dockerfiles I created and used” is citable.
- **GitHub:** If you create a repo for uptk or add more public repos, add one line per repo in §2.
- **Certifications:** LPIC-2, cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), security (e.g. CEH, CompTIA), or others – add a row in §3.
- **Community:** Ubuntu membership level, other FOSS projects, conference talks – add a row or link in §3.
- **Blog / articles:** Links and one-line description in §3.

When you add something, update this file and, if it affects narrative or evidence, mention it in TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE §3 or in the relevant plan (lato sensu, stricto sensu, compliance evidence).
