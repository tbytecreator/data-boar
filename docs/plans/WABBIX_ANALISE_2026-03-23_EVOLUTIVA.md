# Wabbix evolution review — 2026-03-23 (premium WABIX)

**Source (local / operator):** PDF `docs/feedbacks, reviews, comments and criticism/analise_evolucao_data_boar_2026-03-23_premium_wabix.pdf`.

**Source (shared URL in email):** [Google Drive PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mPCindOl8td02qNzR4vb64i4eAx6G7TC/view?usp=drivesdk) — at review time, this URL resolves to the same file name and appears to be the same report material.

**Scope announced by Wabbix:** executive view, detailed technical analysis, DevSecOps/hardening, comparison with previous baseline, prioritized recommendations.

---

## Executive reading (quick anchor)

- The report reinforces a strong direction in docs/compliance narrative, but says core runtime/security defaults still need hardening.
- Highest recurring themes: version coherence, naming/package coherence, secure defaults, failure semantics in parallel execution, and observability/notifications.
- The report states one baseline-tracking file was "not found"; this needs an explicit clarification back to Wabbix because `docs/plans/WABBIX_ANALISE_2026-03-18.md` exists in-repo.

| Version drift (`v1.6.x` vs metadata/README `1.5.4`)                  | Addressed in release flow (**1.6.4+**); keep README/releases aligned per `VERSIONING.md`.                                                                                                                                                                              | ✅ Closed in repo; communicate evidence back to Wabbix |

| Off-band notifications / observability                               | **Phase 1–4.2:** `notifications` config, `utils/notify.py`, scan-complete brief, **`operator.channels`**, **`tenant.by_tenant`**, **dedupe**, **`notification_send_log`** (sem corpo); `notify_webhook.py` grava auditoria manual via `sqlite_path`; retries 5xx/rede. | 🔄 Phase 4.3+ backlog (digest, i18n fino)              |

## Prioritized actions (practical sequence)

1. **Close the baseline alignment loop with Wabbix**
   - **In-repo pointer for reviewers:** [WABBIX_IN_REPO_BASELINE.md](../ops/WABBIX_IN_REPO_BASELINE.md) lists canonical paths (`WABBIX_ANALISE_2026-03-18.md`, `WABBIX_ANALISE_2026-03-23_EVOLUTIVA.md`, feedback PDFs folder).
   - In the next email, mention `docs/plans/WABBIX_ANALISE_2026-03-18.md` explicitly and link or cite the baseline doc above if useful.

1. **Notifications (off-band + scan-complete) — baseline + audit**
   - Implemented: `notifications` config (`config/loader.py`), `utils/notify.py`, `scripts/notify_webhook.py` (com auditoria opcional em SQLite; `--no-audit` em CI sem DB), scan-complete brief after CLI/API scans, `docs/USAGE.md` / `USAGE.pt_BR.md`.
   - **Next optional:** Phase 4.3+ em `PLAN_NOTIFICATIONS_OFFBAND_AND_SCAN_COMPLETE.md` (digest, i18n; caps finos por canal → backlog).

1. **Keep hardening debt visible in one place**
   - Continue tracking "secure-by-default auth" and "honest failure semantics" as explicit follow-ups in `PLANS_TODO.md`.
   - Avoid broad refactors; do small, auditable slices with tests/docs.

## Notes for next Wabbix interaction

- If requested, ask for the shorter executive version as a companion artifact (not replacement), useful for stakeholder sync and prioritization checkpoints.
- Keep requests anchored in the established WRB structure: three temporal layers, explicit baseline markers (date + PR/commit), and chaptered PDF output.
