# Sprints, milestones, and light PM traceability

**Purpose:** Map [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) execution to **sprint-sized** focus windows, **milestones** you can celebrate, and optional **Gantt / Kanban** views—while staying **[token-aware](TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md)** and honest that **resources = you + agent** (not a PMO team). For a **full inventory** of plan files and one-line intent, see **[PLANS_HUB.md](PLANS_HUB.md)** ([pt-BR](PLANS_HUB.pt_BR.md)).

**Português (Brasil):** [SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.pt_BR.md](SPRINTS_AND_MILESTONES.pt_BR.md) — keep **EN + pt-BR** sections aligned when you change themes, milestones, or the SRE block.

**Policy:** [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) stays **English-only** for plan history. This **sprint/SRE guide** is intentionally **bilingual** (like operator-facing docs) so you can skim in pt-BR when tired. The doc does **not** replace `PLANS_TODO`; it **aggregates** the same order into time-boxed **themes**. After each sprint (or mid-sprint), refresh the [status dashboard](PLANS_TODO.md) with `python scripts/plans-stats.py --write` when table rows change.

## 1. How this relates to PMBOK / PRINCE2 (scaled down)

| Idea (big PM)               | Here (2-person, repo-centric)                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------               | -----------------------------                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Charter / business case** | `README.md`, `PLANS_TODO.md` plan status line, commercial/licensing docs.                                                                                                                            |
| **Stages / phases**         | **Hygiene → Lab proof → Tier-2 feature slices → Release** (repeat). Sidequests (housekeeping, homelab “rush”) are **change requests**: they swap into the current sprint or get a **buffer** sprint. |
| **Work breakdown**          | Plan files + `PLANS_TODO` tables; **one row or one slice per agent session** when token-saving.                                                                                                      |
| **Roles**                   | **Operator:** manual (Hub, hardware, study, legal, merges). **Agent:** code/docs/tests/checklists in-repo.                                                                                           |
| **Monitoring**              | Git history, PRs, `plans-stats.py`, release notes under `docs/releases/`, optional GitHub Issues/Projects.                                                                                           |
| **Risk / quality**          | Priority band **A1–A3** before big feature bursts; `scripts/check-all.ps1`; home lab per [HOMELAB_VALIDATION.md](../ops/HOMELAB_VALIDATION.md).                                                      |

**PRINCE2-style tolerance:** For each sprint, define **time** (e.g. 1–2 weeks), **scope** (one primary theme + optional micro-fixes), and **quality** (tests + docs updated for shipped work). If scope explodes, **split** into the next sprint instead of inflating the current one.

---

## 2. Gantt-style visualization (Mermaid)

GitHub (and many Markdown previews) render **Mermaid** `gantt` blocks. The chart below uses **placeholder dates** only to show **relative sequencing**—not a commitment calendar. When you run a real sprint, copy the block and set dates to your sprint start, or use GitHub Milestones with due dates.

**Legend:** **O** = operator-led; **A** = agent-heavy; **M** = mixed.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Indicative sprint lanes (edit dates when you schedule)
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD

    section Hygiene (when critical)
    Band A through A3 (trust baseline)     :crit, hyg1, 2026-03-01, 10d

    section Operator manual
    Home lab order –1L (HOMELAB 9–12)     :o1, after hyg1, 14d

    section Agent-heavy (one plan / slice)
    Tier-2 slice e.g. crypto / DS inv / FN  :a1, after o1, 14d

    section Buffer / sidequests
    Housekeeping PRs, docs, LAB-OP gaps     :b1, after a1, 10d
```

**How to use without lying to the chart:** keep **one active “primary” bar** per calendar week; park the rest in **Backlog** (Kanban below). **Sidequests** consume the **buffer** lane or replace the feature lane for that week—explicitly.

## 3. Kanban-style board (Markdown mirror)

Copy this table into a GitHub **Project** board or a personal doc; move rows by **editing the Status** column each retro.

**Kanban WIP limit:** **1** primary feature theme in **In progress** for agent sessions; **operator** tasks (study, lab hardware) can run **in parallel** on calendar time but should not add a second **agent-heavy** theme without explicit agreement.

### 3.1 Study and certification lane (operator calendar)

- **Primary focus (2026):** **Paid cyber (CWL)** — finish **BTF → C3SA** then §3.2 sequence in [PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md](PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md); **credibility** = **those completions** + **shipped Data Boar** + compliance narrative. This repo’s editor may use **various** models; do **not** treat **Anthropic-only** study as the top lane.
- **Weekly cadence (suggested):** **2** CWL + **1** AI; next week **2** CWL + **1** other subject; repeat—see PORTFOLIO §3.0 and [OPERATOR_MANUAL_ACTIONS.md](../ops/OPERATOR_MANUAL_ACTIONS.md) §1. Ease off when band **A** or shipping spikes.
- **Alternating over the year:** **Anthropic Academy** (or other AI courses) when calendar allows — [Anthropic courses](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/resources/courses); **CCA** = **capstone when eligible**, not a fixed deadline.
- **Same window:** Keep a **thin** **Priority band A** thread—see [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) **–1** / **–1b**.
- **Optional:** Third-party **completion certificates** (e.g. Cursor on Coursera)—HR polish only.
- **Retakes:** If **CCA** (or another exam) fails once, notes in `docs/private/` and **later** attempt.

## 4. Recommended sprints (aggregated, token-optimized)

Sprints are **themes** of 1–2 weeks wall-clock; inside each, you still execute **one slice per agent session** per [TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md](TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md). **Reorder** when Priority band **A** is red.

| Sprint                           | Theme             | Primary outcomes                                                                                                                                           | Operator moments (your calendar)                                    | Agent sessions (typical)                                       |

**Study / certifications:** Treat as a **parallel swimlane** (operator-only). Slot **fixed blocks** (e.g. 1–2×/week) **after** one agent slice that day, not mixed with deep coding—per `TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md` §3 and [PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md](PORTFOLIO_AND_EVIDENCE_SOURCES.md) §3.2.

**Homelab “rush”:** Same as **S1** or **S5**; if it **interrupts** S2–S4, **rename** the sprint to “Lab interrupt” and **resume** the previous theme next—preserves narrative for retros.

### 4.1 Commercial entitlement, activation, and dashboard/API access (not yet a numbered sprint)

The table **S0–S6** does **not** yet include a dedicated row for **subscription vs lab vs consulting SKUs**, **stronger runtime activation/blocking**, or **authentication / RBAC** on the **dashBOARd** and **API**. Today, **Phase 1** licensing is in-repo ([`LICENSING_SPEC.md`](../LICENSING_SPEC.md): `open` / `enforced`, JWT, trial watermarking, revocation); **partner / tier / consulting** claims are a **documented future** extension—see **Priority band A** (A4 private issuer, A7 legal) in [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md).

#### Recommended placement in the timeline

- **Do not defer** until “after all of Tier 2” if you will expose the UI/API beyond a **single trusted operator** on loopback. As soon as **M-LAB** is credible and you aim at **paid subscription** or **shared network** deploys, treat **M-ACCESS** (below) as a **first-class theme**—often **one focused sprint** **interleaved with S2–S4** (e.g. after **S1** or swapping with one Tier-2 slice), **not** only in **S6+**.
- **Order of work (pragmatic):** (1) **Legal + product:** SKU matrix (permanent subscription, trial, partner, lab/consulting) → JWT claims and issuer templates in the **private** issuer repo—**before** baking enforcement into sales contracts. (2) **Fast hardening:** document a **reference pattern** putting the app behind a **reverse proxy** with **OIDC** (e.g. OAuth2 Proxy, Traefik, Caddy) so Microsoft/Google/Entra-style login protects the surface **without** waiting for full in-app auth. (3) **In-app:** API keys or **Bearer** on sensitive routes; session or token gate for dashboard HTML/API used by the UI. (4) **RBAC:** roles such as viewer / operator / admin mapped to identity claims. (5) **Later:** first-class SSO integration, **TOTP**, **WebAuthn / passkeys** (passwordless, comparable to Microsoft Authenticator flows for Office 365). **Bitwarden** (or similar) fits best as **secrets vault** for deployment and client credentials—not usually as the primary **IdP**; align with the customer’s corporate identity (Entra ID, Okta, etc.).
- **Consulting / lab:** distinguish **entitlement** (what the token allows: e.g. consulting-only, row caps, watermark) from **authentication** (who opened the dashBOARd). Both are needed for a clean commercial story.

**Milestone:** **M-ACCESS** (see §5)—“subscription-ready” surfaces and documented identity path.

#### Prioritized follow-up slices (licensing controls + tiered capability packs)

| P4       | Dependency profile policy (`uv` extras)                                     | Installer/operator flow for allowed extras packs (`.[nosql]`, `.[datalake]`, etc.) per entitlement, with audit logging and no silent mutation during scans. |
| P5       | Operator-facing transparency                                                | Explicit docs + runtime info messages + report/audit fields so client/operator can see which entitlement controls are active.                               |

### 4.2 Dashboard web surface cluster (locale **+** issue #86)

**Plans:** [PLAN_DASHBOARD_I18N.md](PLAN_DASHBOARD_I18N.md) and [PLAN_DASHBOARD_REPORTS_ACCESS_CONTROL.md](PLAN_DASHBOARD_REPORTS_ACCESS_CONTROL.md). Same files (`api/routes.py`, templates, middleware); **separate acceptance criteria** (language vs authorization).

| 2     | Higher-priority product slices | —     | Per [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) **near-term** / **Integration / WIP** — i18n implementation stays **deferred** unless operator promotes.                                                          |

**Kanban:** Add **D-WEB** to **Backlog** or **Selected** when you schedule the design pass; keep **one** agent-heavy theme in **In progress** per [TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md](TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md).

### 4.3 Future public website (content split vs pitch) — **not active**

**Status:** Planning only — we are **not** building the site yet.

| Topic                       | Note                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Pitch / presentation**    | Private or stakeholder-facing **short** narrative (e.g. `docs/private/pitch/`); **low technical** depth; seeds **brand** only.                                                              |
| **GitHub compliance-legal** | `COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL`, frameworks, licensing — **governance** depth, not a full HOWTO site.                                                                                                |
| **Future website**          | **Deep** layer: USAGE, TECH_GUIDE, TESTING, Docker/deploy, scenarios, samples, **release notes**, **roadmap with named fronts**, **Docker Hub** + **GitHub**; **synced** to repo versions.  |
| **i18n**                    | Same **locale negotiation pattern** as **dashBOARd** ([PLAN_DASHBOARD_I18N.md](PLAN_DASHBOARD_I18N.md), [PLAN_WEBSITE_AND_DOCS_I18N_FUTURE.md](PLAN_WEBSITE_AND_DOCS_I18N_FUTURE.md) §2.2). |
| **Cadence**                 | New **EN+pt-BR pitch deck generation** → **reminder** to schedule a **website** content/roadmap pass so public depth does not lag.                                                          |

**Cadence suggestion:** **M-TRUST** before a big feature push; **M-OBS** can trail **M-TRUST** in the same or next sprint (small docs/automation); **M-LAB** before customer/demo storytelling; **M-RICH** when the rich-media PR merges; **M-ACCESS** before promising **permanent subscription** or **multi-user** production on a reachable host; **M-SITE-READY** when you intentionally ship a **public** doc/marketing surface (after **M-LOCALE-V1** is wise if you want matching locale UX); **M-RELEASE** whenever VERSIONING says ship.

## 5.0 Trust sub-milestones (recommended for commercialization path)

To reduce ambiguity inside **M-TRUST**, use these small checkpoints:

- **M-TRUST-01:** trust-state contract wired (status/log/report/audit baseline).
- **M-TRUST-02:** confidence-gated output behavior active for degraded/untrusted states.
- **M-TRUST-03:** crypto baseline self-check surfaced at runtime.
- **M-TRUST-04:** review packet format used in one external review cycle.

**Dependency supply chain (PyPI + GitHub Actions):** committed lockfile, **`pip-audit`** in CI, **Dependabot** (pip + actions), **SHA-pinned** Actions on main workflows—documented under **PLANS_TODO** *Integration / WIP*; operator notes in [WORKFLOW_DEFERRED_FOLLOWUPS.md](../ops/WORKFLOW_DEFERRED_FOLLOWUPS.md); **SBOM** artifacts: [ADR 0003](../adr/0003-sbom-roadmap-cyclonedx-then-syft.md).

## 5.1 When to open a PR (quick gate)

| Situation                                                              | Open PR?                          | Version                                                               |
| ---------                                                              | --------                          | -------                                                               |
| Feature + tests + operator docs ready; **`main` passes CI**            | **Yes** — prefer one theme per PR | Bump in same or follow-up PR per [VERSIONING](../releases/) habit     |
| Only typo / markdown in `docs/`                                        | Yes — small PR                    | Often **no** bump; optional **patch** if you tag Hub for traceability |
| Local branch mixes **unrelated** themes (M-ACCESS docs + huge feature) | **Split** before PR               | Easier review + cleaner release notes                                 |
| Dependency / security fix                                              | Yes — urgent                      | **Patch** + lockfile export                                           |

**After merge:** run release checklist (see **1.6.5** table in [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md)); **patch** for additive optional features (e.g. rich media); **minor** for marketed bundles or breaking changes.

## 6. Inside a sprint: sequencing (token-aware)

1. **Start of sprint (15 min):** Pick **one** primary row from [PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) “What to start next” (or band A if critical). Write it in your Kanban **Selected** cell or GitHub Milestone description.
1. **Each agent session:** One **slice** + tests + doc touch; run `.\scripts\check-all.ps1` or `uv run pytest` as per repo policy.
1. **Operator async:** Lab steps, Hub, study—**no** expectation the agent “does lab” for you.
1. **End of sprint (retro, 15 min):** Update `PLANS_TODO` / plan tables; run `python scripts/plans-stats.py --write`; note **sidequests** and **blockers** for the next sprint theme. Optionally capture **one lesson learned** (bullet) or a **blameless** “what broke / what we change” line—see §7.3.
1. **Git hygiene:** Ensure **local commits** recorded progress during the sprint (meaningful units or themed batches)—not a giant uncommitted diff before the next PR or release; see [COMMIT_AND_PR.md](../ops/COMMIT_AND_PR.md) ([pt-BR](../ops/COMMIT_AND_PR.pt_BR.md)) and **`.cursor/rules/execution-priority-and-pr-batching.mdc`**.

## 7. SRE / reliability, security, and governance (multidisciplinary, 2-person scale)

This section ties **plans + PM + workflow + runtime** to practices SRE and platform teams use—**scaled down** so they reduce **chaos, vulnerabilities, dangling work, and rework** without enterprise overhead.

### 7.1 Toil mitigation and automation

| Toil (repetitive, manual)  | Prefer                                                                                        |
| -------------------------  | ------                                                                                        |
| “Did we run lint + tests?” | `scripts/check-all.ps1` (or `pre-commit` + `pytest`) before commit/PR.                        |
| Dependency / alert drift   | Priority band **A1**; lockfile + `requirements.txt` export in same PR as `pyproject` changes. |
| Image hygiene              | **A2/A3**, `scripts/docker-hub-publish.ps1` / docker README flows—avoid one-off tags.         |
| “What’s still open?”       | `gh pr list --state open`; **AGENTS.md** dangling-PR guard at session edges.                  |
| Plan table maintenance     | `python scripts/plans-stats.py --write` when row statuses change.                             |

**Rule:** If you do something **twice** manually and it’s the same steps, **open a slice** to script or document it (token-aware: one slice).

### 7.2 SLI, SLO, SLA, and error budget (lightweight)

- **SLI** = what you measure (e.g. health check 200 rate, scan completion rate). **SLO** = internal target (e.g. 99.9% checks OK). **SLA** = what you **promise** someone else (customers/partners)—often stricter or simpler than internal SLOs.
- **Error budget:** When **M-TRUST** is red (Dependabot/Scout/alerts unaddressed), treat **feature work** as borrowing against reliability—**spend the budget** on A1–A3 first, same as [TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md](TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md) “security-first burst.”
- **Detail and app hooks:** [OBSERVABILITY_SRE.md](../OBSERVABILITY_SRE.md) (`/health`, `/status`, optional metrics, logging policy).

### 7.3 Blameless postmortem, RCA, and lessons learned

Use for **production incidents** *and* for **process misses** (bad release, wrong merge, lost branch, “we forgot operator-help sync”).

- **Blameless:** Focus on **systems and checks**, not who messed up; the team is you + agent + tooling.
- **RCA (root cause):** Ask **why** until you hit a **fixable guardrail** (e.g. “no PR without check-all”, “merge `main` before long doc branch”).
- **Output:** 3–5 lines: timeline, root cause, **action items** (doc, script, CI rule). Store in `docs/private/` for sensitive ops or a short **retro** subsection in your sprint notes.

### 7.4 DevSecOps, cybersecurity, compliance, governance

| Area                     | In this repo                                                                                                                                             |
| ----                     | -------------                                                                                                                                            |
| **DevSecOps**            | Shift-left: tests, Ruff, pip-audit/CodeQL, secrets policy—see [OBSERVABILITY_SRE.md](../OBSERVABILITY_SRE.md) §3, [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).         |
| **Governance**           | Single execution truth in **PLANS_TODO**; commercial/licensing boundaries in dedicated docs; no secrets in tracked files ([AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)). |
| **Compliance narrative** | Tool supports audit **evidence**; you still define retention and process—[PLAN_READINESS_AND_OPERATIONS.md](PLAN_READINESS_AND_OPERATIONS.md) §4.4.      |

### 7.5 Dangling work and rework prevention

- **Branches / PRs:** One coherent PR per theme; merge or **close as superseded** with a pointer (avoid five stale docs PRs).
- **Docs vs code:** After CLI/API changes, schedule **operator-help sync** ([OPERATOR_HELP_AUDIT.md](../OPERATOR_HELP_AUDIT.md)) in **S5** or the same sprint as the feature.
- **Configuration:** Example configs in repo; **secrets** only env/private—never `git add -f` real config.

### 7.6 Instrumentation and observability (application)

- **Today:** Liveness via **`GET /health`**; scan visibility via **`GET /status`**; structured metrics optional—see [OBSERVABILITY_SRE.md](../OBSERVABILITY_SRE.md), [DEPLOY.md](../deploy/DEPLOY.md) healthchecks.
- **Notifications (order 6):** Future **S4** improves **observability of outcomes** (scan finished, failures) for operators—complements metrics.

## 8. Optional tooling (beyond Markdown)

- **GitHub Projects:** Columns = Kanban statuses above; issues = slices (link to plan anchors).
- **Mermaid in PR descriptions:** Paste the same `gantt` block for **that** release’s timeline.
- **Export:** If you need a real PM tool, export **CSV** from `PLANS_TODO` tables manually or script from `plans-stats.py` patterns—keep the **repo** as source of truth.
