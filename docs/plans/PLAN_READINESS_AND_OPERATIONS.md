# Plan: Readiness and operations (meta / “see the forest”)

**Status:** Discovery and checklist (not a delivery plan with phases)
**Purpose:** Capture aspects that are easy to miss when focused on feature plans—so you can decide what to formalise, automate, or document next. No obligation to implement everything; use as a prioritised checklist.

---

## 1. Do you need a custom MCP?

## Recommendation: No, unless you have a specific gap.

- **What you have:** Cursor + Git + CI (tests, Ruff, pip-audit, Sonar when configured) + existing MCPs (e.g. browser, GitKraken) + good docs and plans. That already covers most development and review workflows.
- **When a custom MCP might be worth it:** You need to automate something Cursor and existing tools don’t cover—e.g. calling an internal API, driving a proprietary system, or generating project-specific reports from your repo. Building and maintaining an MCP has a cost; only add one if the benefit is clear (e.g. “we run this check every release and it saves us X hours”).
- **Conclusion:** You’re fine without a custom MCP for current goals. Revisit if a concrete automation need appears.

## 2. Workflow and automation (quick wins)

| Item                                    | To-do / status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------                                  | ----------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Ruff in CI**                          | Done (lint job in `ci.yml`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Pre-commit**                          | Done: Ruff check (--fix) and Ruff format (--check) run on commit. See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and rule `pre-commit-ruff`. Optional: add markdown lint to pre-commit if desired.                                                                                              |
| **Check-all script**                    | Done: `scripts/check-all.ps1` wraps `scripts/pre-commit-and-tests.ps1` so `.\scripts\check-all.ps1` runs lint/format (pre-commit) + full pytest in one command. Use as a local gate before Commit/PR when Agent Review is misbehaving.                                          |
| **Release checklist**                   | Done: In CONTRIBUTING (audit, docs, secrets, lockfile). Release history = git + `docs/releases/`; no separate CHANGELOG required.                                                                                                                                              |
| **QUALITY_WORKFLOW_RECOMMENDATIONS.md** | Done: Lists Bandit, Semgrep, mypy, SBOM. Adopt incrementally when you want an extra safety layer; not required for “being set.”                                                                                                                                                |

## 3. Cursor automation (rules and skills – reminders)

- **Rules:** Later, add Cursor RULEs encoding production hardening defaults (loopback host for non-container runs; production profile requires API key; no new `try/except/pass` without logging; no plaintext passwords in tracked configs).
- **Skills:** Later, add a “Security hardening checklist” skill that walks WABIX findings (host/auth/secrets/Excel formula escaping/parse gates) before marking a change as prod-ready.

## 4. Prioritised checklist (release, security, runbooks, compliance, onboarding, dependency policy)

Each item is a small doc update or script. Status: **Done** | **Not started** | **Optional**. When you implement one, do the change, update EN + pt-BR if docs, then set Status to Done in this file.

| Future Cursor rule/skill: add a security rule/skill that reminds the agent to check Dependabot and Docker Scout summaries before declaring a release “prod-ready”, within token constraints.                                           | Optional    |

## 5. How to use this plan

- **Token-aware:** Each checklist item can be done in one short session; open only this file plus the doc or script you edit. See [TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md](TOKEN_AWARE_USAGE.md) for short vs long-term and one-session workflow.
- **This file is the readiness checklist.** Items are small (doc update or script). No obligation to implement every to-do; “Optional” and “When needed” are valid.
- **When you implement an item:** Do the change (doc or script). If it’s docs, update EN + pt-BR per the documentation policy. Then set the item’s Status to **Done** in §2 or §3 of this file.
- **Revisit when:** You do a release, onboard someone new, or get an audit request. Use the checklist to decide what to formalise next.
- **PLANS_TODO** lists the same goal categories (Release, Security response, Runbooks, Compliance evidence, Onboarding, Dependency policy, Check-all script) and links here so the team doesn’t forget. Status is updated only in this file to avoid duplication.

*Last updated: restructured §4 as prioritised checklist with explicit to-dos and Status; added check-all script to §2; added §3 reminder for future Cursor rules/skills; added Docker/Dependabot vulnerability triage items; updated §5 workflow.*
