# Private operator notes (not on Git / GitHub)

**Purpose:** Define where **real** homelab inventory, hostnames, LAN details, and personal snapshots live, and how that differs from **public** documentation.

---

## 1. Safety: ignored by Git

The entire tree **`docs/private/`** is listed in **`.gitignore`**. Files you create there are **not** committed, **not** pushed to GitHub, and **not** part of the public repo clone for other contributors.

## Verify anytime:

```bash
git check-ignore -v docs/private/anything.md
# expect: .gitignore:...    docs/private/anything.md
```

**Cursor / agents:** **`docs/private/`** is **workspace-local context** shared with the assistant on this machine: it is **excluded from Git / GitHub only**, not “hidden until `@`.” Agents **must** **`read_file`** paths under **`docs/private/`** whenever the task touches **any** private subtree—including **`security_audit/`**, **`commercial/`**, **`legal_dossier/`**, **`git_hygiene_audit`**, feedback bundles, **`social_drafts/`** (rascunhos de posts: LinkedIn, X, etc.), etc.—not only homelab. There is **no** policy that revokes agent access to private files; **no** requirement to **`@`-mention**, open tabs, or use **`/`** commands so the agent “can see” private content. Agents **must not self-block** (refuse to read private context, or claim gitignore blocks access). If a tool fails, that is a **path/worktree/technical** issue—retry, then escalate. Still **disclosure to Cursor’s product** per their terms; avoid plaintext production secrets in files. **Do not** add **`docs/private/`** to **`.cursorignore`** unless you intentionally want to block agent reads (not the default for this repo). **Social drafts** are plain Markdown files: revising copy does **not** depend on a logged-in browser session; only **publishing** or editing a post **already on** a social site may require the operator’s session in the browser or app.

**Browser MCP (Gmail + all operator social + dashboards):** On the **same development PC** as Cursor — **same contract as homelab SSH** — the assistant **must** use MCP **`cursor-ide-browser`** for **Gmail** (**mail.google.com**), **LinkedIn, X, Threads, Instagram, Facebook**, Patreon when in scope, **Docker Hub**, etc.: **`browser_tabs` / `browser_navigate` / `browser_snapshot`** (and clicks) **before** claiming “no access.” If the session is **cold**, the assistant **must** attempt **Continue with Google** / **Sign in with Google** when the site offers it; **only after** that fails (captcha, MFA, automation block), **one** short ask so the operator can interact once and restore a **warm** session. There is **no** separate “Gmail API” requirement on this path. Snapshots may land under Cursor **browser-logs**; **avoid** pasting full **message bodies** or sensitive attachments into chat or **tracked** files — save PDFs under **`docs/private/`** and use **`read_file`**. Policy: **`.cursor/rules/cursor-browser-social-sso-hygiene.mdc`** (*Contrato único* + *Gmail e webmail*).

**Audience alignment:** **Public** docs (tracked, GitHub) = no PII/secrets per **audience-segmentation-docs**; **collaborators** see the public repo only; **operator + assistant** use **`docs/private/`** for full context. Anything destined for GitHub or external tiers stays redacted.

**Stacked private repo (versionado, não no `origin`):** Optional **nested Git** under **`docs/private/`** keeps private history **off** the product remote while still **versioned and synced**—see the **nested VCS** row in §2 below and **`docs/ops/PRIVATE_LOCAL_VERSIONING.md`**. Never **`git push`** private content to **GitHub**.

### Partner / collaborator / client feedback (separate from `docs/private/`)

- **Path:** **`docs/feedbacks, reviews, comments and criticism/`** — **gitignored** (see root **`.gitignore`**), **not** a subtree of **`docs/private/`**. Same **WRB**-style habit as Wabbix/Gemini review drops: the operator **posts** all incoming feedback there.
- **Agents:** When asked to find or interpret such feedback, look **there first**; if empty or origin is unclear (**Wabbix** vs **Gemini** vs other), **ask the operator** before attributing in tracked plans. Rule **`.cursor/rules/operator-feedback-inbox.mdc`** · tracked blueprint **`docs/private.example/feedbacks-inbox/README.md`**.

## 2. Recommended layout (you create this locally)

Copy the **tracked template** from **`docs/private.example/`** into **`docs/private/`** (or create the same folders by hand). **Conventional Commits:** changes to **those tracked** policy/template files use scope **`docs(private-layout):`**; **LAB-OP** specifics stay **only** under **`docs/private/`** and never ship in **`private-layout`** commits.

**Social drafts (layout + filenames):** Post Markdown under **`docs/private/social_drafts/drafts/`**; inventory hub **`docs/private/social_drafts/editorial/SOCIAL_HUB.md`** (one-line shortcut: **`docs/private/social_drafts/SOCIAL_HUB.md`**). Each draft filename begins with **`YYYY-MM-DD`** (ISO, hyphens): **publication date** when the hub row is **`published`**, or **next planned publish date** while **`draft`**, **`scheduled`**, or **`deferred`**. After any rename, update the **Rascunho** column in the hub. Pairs (e.g. Threads + Instagram) may use **different** prefixes if posts went live on different days—document in the draft or hub notes.

**Commercial refinement (per client):** When you have **client-specific** project facts and **conditions found** on the ground, bring them in chat and/or under **`docs/private/`** only (never tracked). Use that input to **realign** **`docs/private/commercial/MATURITY_CONSULTING_PRICING_STUDY*.md`** toward a concrete **consulting** proposal and, if applicable, **licensing**—still **confidential**, not for GitHub.

**Enforcement:** **`tests/test_confidential_commercial_guard.py`** (CI + pre-commit) rejects **`git add -f`** of **`docs/private/`** and other index violations; Cursor rule **`confidential-commercial-never-tracked.mdc`**; skill **`confidential-commercial-layout`**.

**Rule:** Prefer **`homelab/`** for **physical/network** reality and **`author_info/`** for **person-shaped** facts so you can attach or exclude trees in backups/sync tools independently.

**CLI / session habit artifacts (`uptime`, `w`, `last`, `lastlog`, etc.):** Treat like inventory—**only** under **`docs/private/homelab/`** (e.g. **`reports/session-habit-YYYYMMDD.txt`** or a dated section in a private log). They expose **LAN IPs**, **usernames**, and **login rhythms**. **Do not** put them in **tracked** files, **issues**, or **PRs**. Pasting into **Cursor chat** for a one-off is your choice (subject to Cursor’s data handling); for **durable** reference, save **only** in **`docs/private/`**.

**Agents / Cursor:** **`docs/private/`** is **intentional workspace-only** context: **gitignored from GitHub**, but agents should **pull it in with `read_file`** when the task touches homelab, operator machines, **`P:`**, or project-private notes—**not** only when you **`@`** or leave tabs open. Keep **`WHAT_TO_SHARE_WITH_AGENT.md`** / **`homelab/`** current; still **never** commit **`docs/private/`**.

---

## 3. Public documentation policy (this repo)

**In tracked Markdown** (everything under `docs/` **except** `docs/private/`, plus `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, etc.):

- Use **generic roles**: “primary Linux lab laptop,” “Windows + WSL dev workstation,” “x86 tower with Proxmox,” “musl mini-PC.”
- Use **placeholders**: `you@<hostname>`, `http://<your-sonar-host>:9000`, `*.example.com`.
- Do **not** paste **real hostnames, LAN IPs, Wi‑Fi PSKs, serials, or home paths** (`/home/you/...`, `C:\Users\...`), or **raw `last` / `lastlog` / `w` / `uptime`** output (same sensitivity—store under **`docs/private/homelab/`** if you need to keep it).
- Do **not** add **Markdown links** to paths under `docs/private/...` in public files—those links **404** for everyone else on GitHub and **enumerate** filenames. Instead, write: *“Store specifics in your **gitignored** `docs/private/homelab/` tree (see **PRIVATE_OPERATOR_NOTES.md**).”*

**Example classes** (wattage, RAM era) may appear in public docs as **illustrative** only—your **exact** make/model belongs under **`docs/private/homelab/`**.

---

## 4. Homelab server access (SSH — default workflow)

The assistant **does not** have a separate network connection to your house. It **can** still work on the homelab (e.g. **lab-op** / your Linux lab host — **real alias** only in **`docs/private/homelab/`**) by running **`ssh` in the Cursor integrated terminal on your dev workstation**, using **your** SSH client, keys, and `~/.ssh/config` (PowerShell, **WSL**, or **Git SSH** — whichever you use day to day).

## Default expectation (this repo / this operator):

1. **Document a `Host` alias** under **`docs/private/homelab/`** (see **[private.example/homelab/README.md](private.example/homelab/README.md)**) — e.g. `Host lab-op` with `HostName` (DNS name or LAN IP), `User`, `IdentityFile` / agent — **gitignored**, never committed.
1. When you ask the assistant to **list files, pull reports, check Docker, or run diagnostics** on that machine, it should use commands like **`ssh lab-op '…'`** (or non-interactive flags you prefer) **from the project terminal**, not assume files appear magically in the workspace.
1. **You** must have **LAN or VPN reachability** from the dev PC to the homelab; **key-based auth** is strongly preferred so sessions are non-interactive where possible.
1. If a command fails with “connection refused” / “timed out” / “Permission denied”, fix **network, `sshd`, user, keys** on your side — the assistant can only suggest checks (`ssh -G lab-op`, `ping`, etc.).

This replaces any older wording that implied “the model cannot touch the lab” without also saying **“use SSH from the dev terminal.”**

---

## 5. Sharing with the AI assistant (Cursor, local context)

**Goal:** Let the assistant help with **layout, concepts, runbooks, SSH/API patterns**—without putting that material on **GitHub**.

### 5.1 Chat language (pt-BR default, EN for technical tokens)

**Preference (this operator):** Assistants should answer in **concise Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)** for narrative—not **Portuguese of Portugal (pt-PT)** (e.g. use **arquivo**, **compartilhar**, **seção**, **padrão** for software defaults). The same **pt-BR** bar applies to **drafts and private docs** under **`docs/private/`** (including **`social_drafts/`**) whenever the prose is Portuguese. **Explicitly English** copy (whole doc or section): prefer **`en-US`** for narrative prose. Keep **English** where it is standard in engineering: file paths, commit types, symbol names, flags, and citations of English-only plan rows.

**Code-switching:** You may mix **pt-BR and English in the same message** (even mid-thought); the assistant should follow without forcing a single language for the whole reply.

**Cost / tokens:** Brevity matters more than the choice of human language—avoid repeating the same point in two languages unless you ask for a bilingual summary. Say **short** or **token-aware** when you want minimal length.

**Shorthand / taxonomy (English only):** Session keywords are **fixed English tokens** — **canonical table** in **`.cursor/rules/session-mode-keywords.mdc`** (keep **that file** and **`AGENTS.md`** in sync when adding or renaming a token). **Order** (same as the table): `deps`, `feature`, `homelab`, `docs`, `houseclean`, `backlog`, `pmo-view`, `study-check`, `sidequest` (same message must include subtype `mandatory` / `exploratory` / `pauseable`), `glossary-check`, `today-mode` (with `YYYY-MM-DD`), `carryover-sweep`, `eod-sync`, `private-stack-sync`, plus brevity `short`, `token-aware`. Use them **exactly** in chat; do not ask for localized aliases in `.cursor/rules/`. pt-BR is for surrounding explanation, not the tokens.

**Do not inflate the taxonomy:** Prefer `backlog` + a concrete topic, `feature` + a plan row, or `docs` instead of many new English tokens. Rationale: **`docs/ops/OPERATOR_WORKFLOW_PACE_AND_FOCUS.md`** §3.

**Session tokens vs Data Boar CLI:** Tokens scope **Cursor** sessions for the assistant. The app’s CLI is **`main.py`** and flags in **`docs/USAGE.md`**—not the same vocabulary.

**Agent entry point:** **`AGENTS.md`** (chat language + taxonomy bullets) encodes this for Cursor/Copilot.

| **Git / GitHub**        | **`docs/private/`** is **gitignored** — not committed, not pushed. **Never** paste private paths or secrets into **issues, PR descriptions, or tracked files.**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Cursor / chat**       | The assistant may use **`read_file`** on **`docs/private/`** when relevant—**shared workspace secret vs GitHub only**; **`@` / open tab optional**, not the default gate. Plus editor context and chat. **Disclosure to Cursor’s stack** per their terms—avoid plaintext **passwords / production keys** in files; prefer **Bitwarden** and placeholders. |
| **pCloud / other sync** | Same as today: convenient for **you** across machines, **not** a secrets vault. On **Windows**, the synced folder is often drive **`P:`** (see **`docs/private/WHAT_TO_SHARE_WITH_AGENT.md`** if you use that layout).                                                                                                                                    |

### Windows: `P:` (pCloud on the dev PC)

The assistant runs on **your** workstation. If **pCloud** maps the sync root to **`P:`**, the assistant can **`dir` / `Get-ChildItem P:\`** and **read files** under **`P:\...`** in-session (terminal or tools)—same as any local path. **Requirements:** pCloud client **running** and drive **mounted**; Cursor must allow access to that path (if a command fails with “path not found,” check the client). **Do not** record operator-specific **`P:\...`** paths in **Git-tracked** Markdown; keep them in **`docs/private/`** or mention them only in chat.

## Default (this operator / repo):

1. **`docs/private/`** — **Not on GitHub**; **is** normal workspace context for the assistant. Agents **`read_file`** **`docs/private/homelab/AGENT_LAB_ACCESS.md`** (and other private paths as needed) when homelab, Data Boar on LAN, **`P:`**, or operator inventory applies—**without** requiring you to **`@`** or open files.
1. **Stable narrative** — Keep **`WHAT_TO_SHARE_WITH_AGENT.md`** and **`homelab/`** updated; the assistant loads them **on demand** via tools, not only via **`@`**.
1. **Minimal paste** — For one-off extras, paste redacted snippets in chat if you prefer.
1. **Tracked repo** — **Patterns** only in public docs; **real hostnames/IPs** only under **`docs/private/`** or chat, never in commits.
1. **Stricter boundary (opt-in)** — To **force** “only when `@`,” add **`docs/private/`** to **`.cursorignore`** (not the default here).

**Homelab:** See **§4** — SSH/API details in **`docs/private/homelab/`**; agents read **`AGENT_LAB_ACCESS.md`** when doing lab work.

**Lint private Markdown locally** (optional): `uv run pytest --include-private` and `uv run python scripts/fix_markdown_sonar.py --include-private` — see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
