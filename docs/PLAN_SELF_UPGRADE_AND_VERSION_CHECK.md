# Plan: Version check and self-upgrade (with container-aware behaviour)

**Status:** Not started
**Synced with:** [docs/PLANS_TODO.md](PLANS_TODO.md) (central to-do list)

## When implementing steps: update docs and tests; then update PLANS_TODO.md and this file.

This plan adds a way for the app to **check for a stable new release** (GitHub), optionally **self-upgrade** when run on bare metal or in a venv, and when running inside **Docker or Kubernetes** to **inform the operator** with upgrade instructions and release notes instead of modifying the container. It ensures **no loss of scan data, reports, or heatmaps**; **no downgrades** unless explicitly forced; and an **audit trail** of upgrades (who, when, from/to version, config scope) similar to the existing wipe log.

---

## Goals

- **Version check:** Allow the app to verify if a stable new release is available (GitHub: releases or a well-known scheme).
- **Triggers:** Scheduled (cron or internal scheduler), API route (e.g. GET /check-update, optional POST /upgrade with confirmation), and CLI args (e.g. `--check-update`, `--upgrade`).
- **Self-upgrade (non-container):** When not in Docker/Kubernetes, allow upgrading to the new version (or an intermediate version if needed), preserving config, regex/ML/DL overrides, credentials and secrets, and data (SQLite, reports, heatmaps). Behaviour similar to a safe “apt full-upgrade” or Windows update: backup settings, apply new code, restore settings, restart.
- **Container-aware:** When the app detects it is running inside Docker or Kubernetes, **do not** attempt in-place self-upgrade. Instead: report that a newer version is available, show a short description of important changes (from release notes), and give the operator **Docker or Kubernetes commands** to pull and replace the running image (per [docs/deploy/DEPLOY.md](deploy/DEPLOY.md) and Docker Hub).
- **No regressions:** Upgrades must not break the app; settings and data must be preserved. **Downgrades are disallowed** unless the operator uses a **`--force`** (or similar) flag, due to the risk of reintroducing bugs and regressions.
- **Data and audit:** Do **not** cause loss of previous scan sessions, reports, or heatmaps (a separate `--reset-data` already exists for intentional wipe). Protect collected data; keep trends and evolution. Maintain an **upgrade audit log** (who asked for upgrade, when, initial version, resulting version, important config summary, mapped targets) analogous to `data_wipe_log`.

---

## Current state

- **Version:** From `pyproject.toml` and `core/about.py` (major.minor.build, e.g. 1.5.2). Single source of truth: package metadata.
- **Wipe:** `--reset-data` wipes SQLite sessions/findings/failures and deletes report/heatmap files; **data_wipe_log** records reason and timestamp. Upgrade must **never** call wipe logic unless the user explicitly runs `--reset-data`.
- **Config:** Loaded from YAML/JSON; paths for `regex_overrides_file`, `ml_patterns_file`, `dl_patterns_file`; config can contain credentials (see [PLAN_SECRETS_VAULT.md](PLAN_SECRETS_VAULT.md)).
- **Deploy:** Docker Hub `fabioleitao/data_boar:latest` and version tags (e.g. `1.5.1`); Kubernetes uses same image. Upgrading in containers is “pull new image and replace container/pod”.
- **Releases:** GitHub repo (e.g. FabioLeitao/data-boar); releases/tags and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FabioLeitao/data-boar/releases) page. Release notes in `docs/releases/*.md`.

---

## 1. Version source (stable release detection)

**Recommended scheme:** Use **GitHub Releases API** as the source of “stable” version.

- **Endpoint:** `GET <https://api.github.com/repos/FabioLeitao/data-boar/releases/lates>t` (or a specific repo URL from config/env so forks can point to their own repo). Response includes `tag_name` (e.g. `v1.5.2` or `1.5.2`) and `body` (release notes).
- **Alternative:** A well-known file in the repo (e.g. `VERSION` or `docs/STABLE_VERSION`) that contains the current stable version string; the app would fetch the raw file from the default branch (e.g. `<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FabioLeitao/data-boar/main/VERSIO>N`). Prefer **Releases API** so we get tags and notes in one call.
- **Version comparison:** Parse current (from `core/about.py`) and latest (from API or file) as `major.minor.build`; “newer” means strictly greater (no downgrade unless `--force`).
- **Stability:** Consider only **latest** release as “stable” (GitHub “latest” release), or allow config to pin to a specific version channel (e.g. “only notify for 1.x”) in a later iteration.

Exit 0; do not upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                       | ⬜ Pending |
| 2.2 | **CLI:** Add `--upgrade`: check for newer version; if not in container, proceed with self-upgrade (see section 3); if in container, print message and container upgrade commands and exit without changing the image. Require confirmation (e.g. “Type 'yes' to upgrade”) unless `--yes`/non-interactive. **No downgrade** unless `--force` is also passed.                                                                 | ⬜ Pending |

| 3.1 | **Backup:** Before upgrading, write a **temporary backup** of: current config file (full path from CONFIG_PATH or --config); contents (or paths) of `regex_overrides_file`, `ml_patterns_file`, `dl_patterns_file` if present; and a small **upgrade manifest** (current version, timestamp, config path, sqlite_path, report.output_dir, list of target names/types—no secrets). Store in a temp dir or a known location (e.g. `./.upgrade_backup_<timestamp>/`). | ⬜ Pending |
| 3.2 | **Upgrade method:** Prefer **git pull + reinstall** when running from a git clone (detect `.git`); otherwise **download release artifact** (e.g. source tarball from GitHub release) and reinstall with `uv sync` or `pip install -e .` from the extracted dir. Target the **latest** release version (or next stable); no downgrade unless `--force`.                                                                                                             | ⬜ Pending |
| 3.3 | **Restore:** After new code is in place, ensure config path and override file paths still point to the same content (or copy from backup if paths changed). Do **not** overwrite SQLite or report/output dirs; they remain untouched. Credentials and secrets in config (or vault) are preserved by backup/restore of config.                                                                                                                                      | ⬜ Pending |
| 3.4 | **Audit log:** Add an **upgrade log** table (e.g. `upgrade_log`) or reuse/extend a generic “maintenance log”: columns such as `upgraded_at`, `from_version`, `to_version`, `reason` (e.g. “CLI --upgrade”), `config_path`, `targets_summary` (e.g. count and types), `backup_path`. Same idea as `data_wipe_log`: immutable record of who asked for what when and what the state was.                                                                              | ⬜ Pending |
| 3.5 | **Restart:** After upgrade, the process may need to restart to load new code. Document: “Upgrade complete; please restart the API/CLI (e.g. restart systemd service or run main.py again).” Do not kill the process from inside the upgrade step unless design explicitly requires it (e.g. optional “restart now” flag).                                                                                                                                          | ⬜ Pending |

| #   | To-do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Status    |

| 5.1 | **Default: no downgrade.** When “latest” is **lower** than current version (or equal), do not offer upgrade and do not run upgrade. Return “You are already on the latest (or newer) version.”                                               | ⬜ Pending |
| 5.2 | **Force flag:** CLI: `--upgrade --force` allows downgrade (e.g. to latest release even if it is lower). API: `POST /upgrade?force=true` (or body). Document risk: “Downgrading may reintroduce bugs and regressions; use only if necessary.” | ⬜ Pending |

| 6.1 | **No data loss:** Upgrade logic must **never** call `wipe_all_data` or delete SQLite, reports, or heatmaps. The only way to wipe remains `--reset-data` (and any future explicit wipe API). Preserve `sqlite_path`, `report.output_dir`, and all files under them (except what the user explicitly deletes via wipe).    | ⬜ Pending |
| 6.2 | **Config and overrides:** Backup and restore ensure that `config.yaml` (and paths to `regex_overrides_file`, `ml_patterns_file`, `dl_patterns_file`) and their contents (or references) are reapplied after upgrade so that “look and feel,” capabilities, credentials and secrets, and mapped targets remain effective. | ⬜ Pending |
| 6.3 | **Audit trail:** Upgrade log records: who triggered (CLI user, API caller if identifiable), when, from_version, to_version, config_path, optional targets_summary (e.g. “3 database, 2 filesystem”), backup_path. Keeps an audit trail of upgrades alongside wipe log.                                                   | ⬜ Pending |

| 7.1 | **Tests:** Unit tests for version comparison (newer, equal, older); for “in container” detection (mock env/filesystem); for backup manifest content (no secrets in manifest). Integration test: mock GitHub API response and assert /check-update and --check-update output.                                       | ⬜ Pending |
| 7.2 | **Docs:** Update USAGE (EN and pt-BR) with `--check-update`, `--upgrade`, `--force`; GET `/check-update` and optional POST `/upgrade`; container behaviour and Docker/Kubernetes commands. Update DEPLOY.md to reference “upgrade” section. Add short “Version check and upgrade” section to README or TECH_GUIDE. | ⬜ Pending |
| 7.3 | **Release notes:** When publishing a release, ensure GitHub Release has tag and body so the version-check flow can show useful excerpt to operators.                                                                                                                                                               | ⬜ Pending |

## 8. Order of execution (recommended)

1. **Version source and comparison** (1.1–1.3).
1. **Container detection and “no upgrade in container”** (4.1–4.4) so CLI/API can return correct message and commands.
1. **CLI --check-update and --upgrade** (2.1, 2.2) and **API GET /check-update** (2.3).
1. **Backup and upgrade log** (3.1, 3.4, 6.1–6.3).
1. **Self-upgrade steps** (3.2, 3.3, 3.5) and **no downgrade / --force** (5.1, 5.2).
1. **Optional POST /upgrade** (2.4) and **schedule** (2.5).
1. **Tests and docs** (7.1–7.3).

## Alternatives or simplifications

- **No self-upgrade in first iteration:** Only implement version check and container instructions; operators always upgrade manually (pip/uv/git or container pull). Reduces risk and complexity.
- **Well-known file instead of API:** If GitHub API rate limits or auth are a concern, use a static file (e.g. `VERSION` or `docs/STABLE_VERSION`) on the default branch; no release notes excerpt unless we add a second file (e.g. `LATEST_RELEASE_NOTES.txt`).
- **Upgrade log in same DB:** Reuse or extend a single “maintenance_events” table (wipe, upgrade) with an `event_type` column instead of a separate upgrade_log table, so one place to query “what happened when.”
