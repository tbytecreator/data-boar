# python\_lgpd\_crawler

Dashboard com capacidade de sondagem, apreciação e mapeamento dos dados pessoais e/ou sensíveis para busca de violações de compliance de acordo com as recomendações do LGPD (adaptável mediante dicionário de regras)

Web application that scans **databases** (for now) for compliance violations according to **LGPD** and other regulations. Implemented in Python3 with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.


##### Implementation:

###### Solution Overview

1. **Dashboard** - Shows compliance status and scan results

2. **Scanner** - Connects to databases and identifies sensitive data

3. **Configuration** - Manages database connections and scan settings

###### Frontend 

The application includes three main pages:

1. **Dashboard** (index.html):

* Shows compliance requirements and current status
* Lists all configured databases
* Shows recent scan results

2. **Scanning** (scan.html):

* Interface to start scans
* Shows scan progress

3. **Configuration** (config.html):

* Form to add new database connections
* List of existing configurations


##### TODO:

###### Key goals!

1. Database Connection Management:

* Supports PostgreSQL and MySQL (mariaDB)
* Stores configuration securely

2. Compliance Checking:

* Checks for common compliance requirements
* Identifies sensitive data patterns (email, phone, CPF, gender, etc.) via some form of regex

3. Reporting:

* Generates local database (SQLite) indicating finds and possible vectors of violations of privacy
* Generates detailed PDF or Spreadsheet reports of quantities, locations, heatmap...
* Summarizes findings and compliance status including some sort of risc score (TBD) and recommendations

4. User-Friendly Interface:

* Clean dashboard showing scan history (including age of last data gathering)
* Progress tracking for ongoing scans (if so possible)
* Easy configuration management (credentials, DBE flavor (and connector), subsets, etc.)

5. How to execute the app so far:
* ✅ CLI mode
 ```
python main.py --cli
 ```
* ✅ API mode
 ```
python main.py --api
 ```


###### How to Extend This Solution?

1. Add More Compliance Requirements:

* Add additional checks to the COMPLIANCE\_REQUIREMENTS dictionary (such as GDPR or CCPA) besides the current LGPD

2. Implement Actual Database Scanning:

* Connect to real databases using the get\_db\_connection function or SQLAlchemy library
* Scan tables for further sensitive data patterns (via some form of regex) eigther collumn name or actual record and use it to teach machine learning to improve recognition

3. Add More Data Types:

* Expand the PersonalDataPattern class to include more patterns (personal or sensitive data), not hardcoded if feasable
* Add support for different languages and name formats (mostly latin based, but not only, due to the international nature of the target company)
* Add support for different data base engines, such as MS SQL, Oracle, etc. (including their connectors, data sets, schemas, etc)
* Add support for different data inputs types besides BDE, such as DBF, CSV, XLS, XLSX, ODP, PMDX files, emails or forms that might also store personal and/or sensitive data
* Add support for some sort of API integration (SOAP or REST) to gather such data where available (many systems and/or solutions might already expose data bases for other intentions that might assist us)

4. Enhance Reporting:

* Add more detailed statistics to reports based on authoritative feedbacks
* Include database schema diagrams with forein keys connections, and cross reference of "possible same individual" as data gets unhidden (further indication of risc assestment)
