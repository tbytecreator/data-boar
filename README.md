## For decision-makers and compliance leads

Your organization needs to know **where** personal and sensitive data lives—to comply with **LGPD**, **GDPR**, **CCPA**, **HIPAA**, **GLBA** and to avoid costly surprises. **Data Boar** helps you build **compliance awareness** and surface **possible violations** without out-of-control cost: one configurable engine that scans your data and reports what it finds, so IT, cybersecurity, compliance, and DPOs can take informed action.

**What we surface:** Beyond obvious PII (CPF, CNPJ – including the new alphanumeric format, email, phone), we use **AI** (ML and optional DL) to detect **sensitive categories** (health, religion, political opinion, biometric, genetic—LGPD Art. 5 II, GDPR Art. 9), **quasi-identifier combinations** (LGPD Art. 5, GDPR Recital 26), and **possible minor data** (LGPD Art. 14, GDPR Art. 8). We recognise regional document names and flag ambiguous identifiers for manual confirmation, and reveal exposure across **legacy columns**, **exports**, **dashboards**, and **multiple sources** in one view—so you see gaps that manual checks or rule-only tools often miss.

The real risk—**shadow IT** and beyond—often hides in parallel spreadsheets, forgotten folders, legacy databases, lack of standardization, tangled flows, poorly documented applications, exceptions, and excessive data collection. Data Boar keeps sniffing through your data soup to uncover those hidden ingredients—including renamed or cloaked files and weaker transport or storage—so compliance and legal teams see what’s really there, not just how it’s presented. **Rich media today:** optional **metadata** scans, **image OCR**, and **subtitle** sidecars help surface ingredients that plain full-text search often misses. **On the horizon (phased, often opt-in):** stronger signals for **embedded trackers**, **steganography**, and **document-layer tricks** (microtext, Unicode cloaking, nested embedded objects)—without promising exhaustive detection until each slice ships.

**Hungry for your data soup:** Like a **boar**, we dig into many sources and don't stop at the surface. Whatever the ingredients—**files**, **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **APIs**, **Power BI**, **Dataverse**, **SharePoint**, **SMB/NFS**, and more—we're built to ingest and digest it. We **do not store or exfiltrate** PII, only **metadata** (where found, pattern type, sensitivity), so you get visibility for remediation without moving data. For a concise summary for legal and compliance teams, see [Compliance and legal](docs/COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL.md).

**U.S. health (HIPAA / HITECH / H.R. 7898):** Built-in **HIPAA** language supports **technical inventory** of possible **PHI/ePHI** exposure—**not** automated breach analysis, notification counts, **HHS OCR** response workflows, or **P.L. 116-321** “safe harbor” / **recognized security practices** certification. See [Compliance and legal](docs/COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL.md) for scope and limits.

**Why it holds up:** One engine, **config-driven** (regex, ML/DL terms, norm tags, recommendation overrides)—no code changes to align with different frameworks. **Excel reports**, **heatmaps**, and **trends** across sessions; **schedulable** scans via API. We support **LGPD**, **GDPR**, **CCPA**, **HIPAA**, **GLBA** out of the box; **sample configs** for **UK GDPR**, **EU GDPR**, **Benelux**, **PIPEDA**, **POPIA**, **APPI**, **PCI-DSS**, and other regions ship with **framework guidance** and live under **compliance-samples** (navigate from the table below).

Multilingual and legacy encodings are supported; **configurable timeouts** and **security hardening** (validation, headers, audit) are in place. **Compressed files:** scan inside archives (zip, tar, gz, 7z with optional extra) via **config**, **CLI**, or the **dashboard**—full flags and I/O notes are in **USAGE** (table below). Optional **content-type** detection helps find renamed or cloaked files (e.g. PDFs disguised as .txt); early **crypto/transport** visibility (e.g. TLS vs plaintext) is collected for database and API targets.

**Sniffing with judgment on the file trail:** Plain-text reads use a **configurable character budget** so the engine sees real structure—not a useless nib—before it decides; **entertainment-shaped** content routes **noisy ML hints** into a **review band** instead of crowding the report with spurious “certain” alerts, while **hard pattern hits** (IDs, payment data, strong PII) stay decisive for triage.

**Roadmap:** We continue to broaden **discovery** (richer files and media, **cloud** and **enterprise** connectors), improve **alerts** when scans finish, and keep **security and dependency** practices strong. **Language** coverage in the UI and docs, and **regional** compliance samples, grow **incrementally** with demand—not every market at once. **For boards and audits:** the story stays **executive-readable**—you can point to **direction and evidence** on data visibility and compliance posture without asking stakeholders to parse an engineering-only roadmap. For frameworks (e.g. ISO 27701, SOC 2), minors’ privacy **sample profiles**, SBOM plans, API health signals, and what is already shipped vs phased, see **[Compliance and legal](docs/COMPLIANCE_AND_LEGAL.md)** and **[docs/releases/](docs/releases/)**—detail stays there so this pitch stays readable for buyers and legal leads.

**We invite you to get in touch** to see how Data Boar can support your compliance journey. Optional **professional services**—helping map your **data soup** and tune configuration for your regulatory mix—are summarised under *Professional services* on the **Compliance and legal** page linked above.

**Typical scenarios:** Preparing for an audit or regulator request; mapping data before a migration or DLP rollout; raising compliance awareness without a full war room.

## Technical overview

Data Boar runs as a **one-shot CLI** audit or as a **REST API** (default port 8088) with a web dashboard. You configure **targets** (databases, filesystems, APIs, shares, Power BI, Dataverse) and **sensitivity detection** (regex + ML, optional DL) in a single **YAML or JSON** config file. It writes findings and session metadata to a local **SQLite** database and produces **Excel reports** and a **heatmap PNG** per session.

**Quick start (from repo root):** On **Linux (native, not Docker)**, install system libraries **before** `uv sync`—see [Technical guide — Requirements and environment preparation](docs/TECH_GUIDE.md#requirements-and-environment-preparation) (example `apt` line includes `libpq-dev`, `unixodbc-dev`, and related headers; add `default-libmysqlclient-dev` if building **mysqlclient**). Then `uv sync` → prepare `config.yaml` (see `deploy/config.example.yaml` and [USAGE](docs/USAGE.md)) → `uv run python main.py --config config.yaml` for one-shot, or `uv run python main.py --config config.yaml --web --allow-insecure-http` for plaintext API/dashboard (default bind `127.0.0.1`, e.g. [http://127.0.0.1:8088/](http://127.0.0.1:8088/); for TLS use `--https-cert-file` / `--https-key-file`; use `--host 0.0.0.0` only with network controls). Full flags: `uv run python main.py --help`. **Do not commit** root `config.yaml` (`.gitignore`); it may contain LAN paths and secrets—see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#public-repo-hygiene-lan-credentials).
