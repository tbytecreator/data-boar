"""
RCA block contract for ``cli.reporter`` failure paths (Slice 2).

Why this lives in the test suite (Julia Evans-style note):

- A ``data-boar-report`` failure used to surface as a bare Python traceback or
  a single-line stderr message. Operators could not tell whether the regression
  was in the YAML config, the SQLite file, or the renderer — they had to page
  the maintainer to read the traceback.
- This test pins the **shape** of the new RCA block (Sysinternals-style:
  step, error_type, error_message, hypothesis, next_command, doctrine) so a
  refactor cannot silently regress it. Doctrine references:
  ``docs/ops/inspirations/INTERNAL_DIAGNOSTIC_AESTHETICS.md`` §2.2 and
  ``docs/ops/inspirations/DEFENSIVE_SCANNING_MANIFESTO.md`` §1.

Defensive posture:

- The tests run entirely against a temp directory and a missing or broken
  SQLite path. There is no network, no live DB, no read on customer data.
